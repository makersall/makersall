I could start with some quotes from Keynes
that 100 years from now – around 2030 – our economy would be so productive that our basic economic needs would be solved.
The biggest obstacle to realizing the fruits of our labor would be in our minds. We might still have folks working, Keynes said:
and that got me thinking.
{May be another way of thinking about Makers All is that even if we don't end up with an overwhelming problem we have to solve – i.e. mass unemployment – maybe this is an opportunity to stop and ask ourselves, what do we really want?
The advantages of Makers All is that if a wide range of people in most communities had the skills of robotics, AI, 3-D printing, wearables, etc. it's a lot easier to see what everyone working 15 hours a day would look like.

Or to put it another way, let's suppose that the skeptics are right, that we had to eliminating a lot of jobs – many of which were jobs most folks would prefer not to have anyways – and we end up with a bunch of high skilled jobs coming out of the robotics industry. Makers All allows us to imagine a world in which we could actually split up that work so that – probably in addition to a universal basic income – lots of people could work only 15 hours a week and make a good living.

So what am I saying?

I'm saying that Makers All provides us with more than one avenue to deal with an uncertain future where we can't know in advance exactly what hazards and what opportunities we will face.

Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren)
http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf
But this is only a temporary phase of maladjustment. All this means in the long run that mankind is solving its economic problem. I would predict that the standard of life in progressive countries one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as it is to-day. There would be nothing surprising in this even in the light of our present knowledge. It would not be foolish to contemplate the possibility of afar greater progress still. 
II 
Let us, for the sake of argument, suppose that a hundred years hence we are all of us, on the average, eight times better off in the economic sense than we are

to-day. Assuredly there need be nothing here to surprise us. 
Now it is true that the needs of human beings may seem to be insatiable. But they fall into two classes --those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be, and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above, makes us feel superior to, our fellows. Needs of the second class, those which satisfy the desire for superiority, may indeed be insatiable; for the higher the general level, the higher still are they. But this is not so true of the absolute needs-a point may soon be reached, much sooner perhaps than we are all of us aware of, when these needs are satisfied in the sense that we prefer to devote our further energies to non-economic purposes. 
Now for my conclusion, which you will find, I think, to become more and more startling to the imagination the longer you think about it. 
I draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no important increase in population, the economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. This means that the economic problem is not-if we look into the future-the permanent problem of the human race. 
Why, you may ask, is this so startling? It is startling because-if, instead of looking into the future, we look into the past-we find that the economic problem, the struggle for subsistence, always has been hitherto the primary, most pressing problem of the human race-not only of the human race, but of the whole of the biological kingdom from the beginnings of life in its most primitive forms. 
Thus we have been expressly evolved by nature-with all our impulses and deepest instincts-for the purpose of solving the economic problem. If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose. 
Will this be a benefit? If one believes at all in the real values of life, the prospect at least opens up the possibility of benefit. Yet I think with dread of the readjustment of the habits and instincts of the ordinary man, bred into him for countless generations, which he may be asked to discard within a few decades. 
To use the language of to-day-must we not expect a general “nervous breakdown”? We already have a little experience of what I mean -a nervous breakdown of the sort which is already common enough in England and the United States amongst the wives of the well-to-do classes, unfortunate women, many of them, who have been deprived by their wealth of their traditional tasks and occupations--who cannot find it sufficiently amusing, when deprived of the spur of economic necessity, to cook and clean and mend, yet are quite unable to find anything more amusing. 
To those who sweat for their daily bread leisure is a longed--for sweet-until they get it.
Yet there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to strive and not to enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary person, with no special talents, to occupy himself, especially if he no longer has roots in the soil or in custom or in the beloved conventions of a traditional society. To judge from the behaviour and the achievements of the wealthy classes to-day in any quarter of the world, the outlook is very depressing! For these are, so to speak, our advance guard-those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us and pitching their camp there. For they have most of them failed disastrously, so it seems to me-those who have an independent income but no associations or duties or ties-to solve the problem which has been set them. 
I feel sure that with a little more experience we shall use the new-found bounty of nature quite differently from the way in which the rich use it to-day, and will map out for ourselves a plan of life quite otherwise than theirs. 
For many ages to come the old Adam will be so strong in us that everybody will need to do some work if he is to be contented. We shall do more things for ourselves than is usual with the rich to-day, only too glad to have small duties and tasks and routines. But beyond this, we shall endeavour to spread the bread thin on the butter-to make what work there is still to be done to be as widely shared as possible. Three-hour shifts or a fifteen-hour week may put off the problem for a great while. For three hours a day is quite enough to satisfy the old Adam in most of us!

		<title>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Full Employment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				When I started the journey that led me here, the last thing I had in mind was robots.

I was trying to figure out a strategy for progressives to move the economy towards creating good jobs for all. Then I started bumping into articles about the revolutions going on in robotics and artificial intelligence. The more I read, the more I realized I needed a Plan B, because there's a pretty good chance that between 2025 and 2040, robots and automation will eliminate 30% to 70% of all jobs. 

To put that in context, the unemployment rate at the height of the Great Depression was   <a href="http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1528.html">25%</a>.

You might say, isn’t 2040 too far in the future to worry about? 

Let’s put it in perspective. If a child is born today and that child goes to college, by the time they've settled into their first job it’s 2040. So yeah, we've got some time. But 2040 isn't some far-off sci-fi future; it’s our kids' future.

Wrapping our heads around catastrophe that’s a little off in the future is pretty hard. But this one is even trickier. Unlike, say, climate change we really can’t know in advance when robotics, AI, and automation will have a big impact. It could turn out that we don’t have to worry it until 2140. If that’s the case, then there’s no point sweating it – things may have changed so much by then that it won’t matter. Or it could turn out that robots, AI, and automation create mass unemployment by 2030. We could make an educated guess, but we can’t really know.

So what do we do? 

I think the answer isn't a specific policy, it's a strategy. I call it Makers All.

Makers All argues that the best way to protect our children’s future is to make sure that from Harlem to Harlan County, every community develops a web of folks with a broad range of expertise in robotics/AI – as well as the emerging technologies of 3-D printing, wearables, and the Internet of things – who are organized to fight to ensure that this new technology is used to benefit all of our communities.  If we can democratize this knowledge, I think we've got a fighting chance:
<ul><li> It’ll give these communities the grounding they’ll need to take on the “makers versus takers” frame the 1% will use. In a world where huge numbers of people will be permanently unemployed, Makers All will make it much easier to smack down the idea that the people who can’t find jobs are just lazy parasites and argue instead that the crisis is about people who have the skills but not the opportunities to make a living and contribute to our society. </li>
<li> It’ll give these communities enough of an understanding of how the tech works to be able to organize around seemingly arcane issues – e.g., who owns the knowledge about robots, a.k.a. intellectual property law – that will have a huge impact on our lives.</li>
<li> It’ll create opportunities for options of how we shape/nudge the economy that we wouldn’t have otherwise – e.g., a 21st-century equivalent of 40 Acres and a Mule.</li></ul>
Equally importantly, it’ll also give us a chance to use what could be a truly unique opportunity to build a more just and abundant world for all.

In this blog, I’m going to unpack these ideas and explore the nuts &amp; bolts of turning Makers All into a reality.		]]></content:encoded>

Wise notes that they are notoriously bad at identifying and successfully grabbing products that are “blobs” — in other words, those that don’t have square or rectangular sides — or that are “cute, furry, or squishy.”That’s a computer vision problem, she explained. Over time, she predicted, companies will standardize on packaging that the robots can pick up, which could solve the problem.</p></blockquote><p>A lot of people argue computers won&#039;t be able to replace many jobs people do, because there are so many things people can do that computers can&#039;t.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				A useful reality check on how primitive today's robots are. According to Popular Science's&nbsp;Erik Sofge, the massive DARPA Robotics Challenge&nbsp;last month was a <a href="http://www.popsci.com/darpa-robotics-challenge-was-bust-why-darpa-needs-try-again">bust</a>:
<blockquote>&nbsp;the robot that racked up the most points, in the least amount of time, took nearly 45 minutes to complete a series of eight tasks that my kindergarten-age daughter could probably accomplish in 10 minutes.</blockquote>
And unlike toddlers, they couldn't handle a spill:
<blockquote>Nearly every team whose machine tumbled simply ate the 10 minute time penalty. Some did so multiple times, implying a scenario where responders bring an entire squad of identical, blundering bots to a disaster, knowing full well that they're liable to faceplant while facing such harrowing obstacles as a door handle, or a handful of stairs....

When robots hit the ground at the DRC, which was constantly, they didn't get up. They either lay there like corpses, or continued whatever movement they were engaged in before the seemingly inevitable loss of balance.&nbsp;</blockquote>
In other words, today the best way to stop a robot from taking your job is to knock it on its ass.		]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote><p>"In New York City in 2005, only 24 percent of taxi fares went toward vehicle costs, with 57 percent going to drivers … driver income constitutes $97,600 per year, which could more than cover the incremental cost of autonomous vehicle technology [estimated at $150,000]. Even using current costs, if financed using identical model assumptions for vehicle capital, this would amount to $36,500 per year, 37 percent of New York City taxi driver income and 21 percent of total taxi fares. Therefore, autonomous taxis could replace current taxis at current autonomous vehicle costs and possibly even lower fares, providing an important early market niche." </p></blockquote>
<p> Economics isn't destiny; the folks who own and work for the taxi industry are not going down without a fight, and as they have demonstrated in the past, they have plenty of political muscle in most big cities.  But at this point taxi drivers are living on borrowed time.</p>		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				According to Stephen Hawking, the real danger we face isn't mass unemployment due to robots/AI, it's the unequal distribution of the resulting wealth:

<blockquote>
  If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.

		<title>AI/Robots Will Create Jobs like Data Scientist… And Then Automate Them</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Sure, robots and AI may destroy a lot of jobs, say the cheerleaders, but they'll create plenty more jobs. But how vulnerable to automation are these new jobs? Exhibit A: Data Science.  <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/automating-big-data-analysis-1016">MIT News</a> says MIT is on the way to automating a lot of the work Data Scientists now do when using machine learning:

<blockquote>
  MIT researchers aim to take the human element out of big-data analysis, with a new system that not only searches for patterns but designs the feature set, too. To test the first prototype of their system, they enrolled it in three data science competitions, in which it competed against human teams to find predictive patterns in unfamiliar data sets. Of the 906 teams participating in the three competitions, the researchers’ “Data Science Machine” finished ahead of 615.
  
  In two of the three competitions, the predictions made by the Data Science Machine were 94 percent and 96 percent as accurate as the winning submissions. In the third, the figure was a more modest 87 percent. But where the teams of humans typically labored over their prediction algorithms for months, the Data Science Machine took somewhere between two and 12 hours to produce each of its entries.
</blockquote>

Or to put it another way: about 2 years ago I started picking up some machine learning techniques.  If I keep working at it, by the time I get good at it odds are the Data Science Machine will be way better at it than I am.

The current version of the Data Science Machine isn't really a fair comparison to the skills Data Scientists need.  With a contest, you know exactly what problem you need to solve from the get-go.  In real life, often half the battle is figuring out what problem is possible and/or worthwhile to solve.  And there are other issues where it's unlikely that simple AI will outstrip human creativity any time soon.

Odds are Data Science jobs won't vanish tomorrow; the demand for Data Scientists is enormous.  Then again, that's why researchers as well as Microsoft, IBM, and many other players are working furiously to automate them out of existence.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Cigar Makers, Craft Unions</title>

In the early 1930s, managers introduced cigar-making machines which began to replace hand rollers.... Following the war, machines came into wide use in most factories, and the number of cigar workers declined from 13,000 to about 5,500 by the mid-1950s. By contrast, production more than doubled to 700 million cigars a year.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar_Makers%27_International_Union

Cigar Makers' International Union
ForerunnersEdit

<img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/72/Gompers-Samuel-1894.jpg/250px-Gompers-Samuel-1894.jpg" width="250" height="356" class="thumbimage">
Samuel Gompers, perennial President of the American Federation of Labor for more than three decades, was an important leader of the Cigar Makers' International Union.
The first local Cigar Makers' Union was founded in Baltimore, Maryland in 1851 by craftsmen who were opposed to the importation of low-cost laborers from Germany.[1] This was followed two or three years later by the establishment of a New York Cigarmakers' Union of about 70 members, mostly emigrants from England or Germany. This group quickly expanded in size to include about 160 of the city's 800 or so cigar workers before collapsing in an unsuccessful strike to avert a general cut in wages.[1]

The defeat proved temporary, as in 1859 another New York union was established in response to complaints about the business behavior of one manufacturer named Tom Little. About 250 cigarmakers were brought into the union before it, too, collapsed in a failed strike 10 months later.[1]

Part of the reason for the failure of cigar maker strikes was the lack of concentration of the industry. Prior to the American Civil War of 1861-1865, cigar makers were typically independent proprietors. Before 1889, all cigars were made by hand. The cigar roller or craftsman worked for himself, buying tobacco in small quantities as he needed it, using only his hands and a cutting blade to fabricate finished cigars in the place in which he lived.[2]

Samuel Gompers, himself a skilled cigar maker, echoed similar sentiments in his memoirs:

"In every community where the demand for cigars was sufficient to warrant, the cigar maker worked and sold his own cigars direct to the consuming public. Rarely did he employ helpers and then not more than one or two journeymen. If the journeyman became dissatisfied for any reason, he needed but small capital to become his own employer."[3]

In New York City, one of the leading hubs of cigar production in the 1860s, it was typical for cigar manufacturers to furnish the raw material to the cigar makers they employed, who would pay a deposit of nearly double the value of the tobacco supplied. The cigar makers would then carry their stock home and make the cigars in their own rooms, bringing back completed cigars to the manufacturer for payment.[4] Defects in workmanship would result in the manufacturer refusing to take the cigars, which would be left in the possession of the cigarmaker to dispose of as he was best able.[4]

During the Civil War, the revenue-starved federal government instituted an internal revenue tax on cigars and established a system of permits for employers and employees.[4] As the tax system tightened its embrace, this system of so-called "turn-in jobs" was eliminated; henceforth the employer would have to have some sort of physical facility. Many previously self-employed cigar makers were consequently driven out of business, forced to work in the employ of bonded cigar manufacturers. This accelerated the trend towards unionization of the industry.

FoundationEdit

In 1863 came the first effort to establish a national union of cigar makers, bringing delegates from New York, Philadelphia, Newark, Cleveland, New Haven, Boston, Detroit, and elsewhere to a preliminary convention in Philadelphia.[1] This gathering decided to move forward with the establishment of a national union and called a foundation convention for the group for June 21, 1864, in New York City.[1]

The union formed at this New York meeting was initially known as the National Union of Cigar Makers of America, before changing its name to the Journeymen Cigar Makers' International Union (CMIU) in 1867.[5]

One of the early challenges faced by the CMIU related to a new system of manufacture established in the first years of the 1870s. The years 1871 and 1872 saw the arrival of a substantial wave of immigrants from Bohemia, a region which now comprises the western two-thirds of the Czech Republic. This new group of arrivals provided manufacturers with a ready source of low-cost labor. A simplified system of cigar production was also emerging at the same time, assisted by the appearance in 1867 of a wooden mold or form, which decreased assembly time during the bunching process by eliminating one step in the manufacture of cigars by hand.[6] Cigar manufacturers, seeking to realize larger profits from economies of scale using the new assembly methods would buy or rent a block of tenements and then sublet the apartments to cigar makers and their families — thereby technically fulfilling the government requirement of maintaining a physical facility.[7]

Traditional craft skill was thus devalued and the cigar makers demoralized. High union initiation fees further limited the size of the unionized workforce. English-speaking Local 15 of the CMIU in New York City evaporated to fewer than 50; German-speaking Local 90 to just 85; and the union as a whole to only 3,771 members in 1873.[7]

The CMIU concentrated its efforts on publicizing the abuses inherent in the so-called "tenement house system," ultimately forcing the New York Board of Health to take notice of the situation. The report of the Board of Health whitewashed the tenement system, making it seem as though the tenements represented superior living quarters, an action which enraged the unionized cigar makers and mobilized other unions of the city to the cigar makers' cause.[8]

DevelopmentEdit

The economic crisis of 1877 was very nearly fatal to the organization, with a coordinated lockout by the employers' association of cigar manufacturers putting 7,000 workers out on the street in a lockout lasting four months.[1] Only 131 of the union's approximately 6,000 members remained in the union after the strike and the CMIU did not again exceed the 1,000 member mark until a full year later.[1]

The CMIU was instrumental in the formation of the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions in 1881, and organization which later evolved into the American Federation of Labor (AF of L).

The years 1879 to 1883 were a period of dramatic growth, with the number of union locals increasing from 35 to 185, with about 10,000 members.[1]

In 1882, bitter disagreement over the question of political endorsements lead to a split of the union, with about 1,800 New York City cigarmakers seceding to form the Cigarmakers' Progressive Union of America.[1] Many of the members of this new organization were members of the Socialist Labor Party of America and were unwilling to see the national union work hand-in-glove with established, sometimes corrupt, politicians of the Democratic and Republican parties.[1] The two sibling unions were in a position of competing with one another and they engaged in a bitter and destructive four year war, undercutting one anonther's contracts in order to gain recognition, until they once again reunited in 1886.

The American Federation of Labor chartered the Cigar Makers in 1887. George W. Perkins became president of the CMIU in 1892, a post he held until 1927. Perkins disdain for machine-made cigars and manufacture was reflected in his dogged refusal to extend CMIU membership to the semi-skilled and unskilled workers employed in machine cigar factories throughout his term as president.

As of 1925, the CMIU included 13,463 men and 3,186 women out of an American national work force in the industry of 28,293 men and 50,648 women.[9] Of some 10,320 cigar-making shops known to the union, an impressive 7,180 used union labor, but of these 3,246 consisted of shops in which the owner was the only worker employed.[9]

IdeologyEdit

Although the Cigar Makers' Union initially barred black and female cigar makers from membership at its 2nd National Convention, held in Cleveland, Ohio in 1865, it reversed this decision two years later and came to be a forerunner in the representation of workers of various ethnic backgrounds.[1] The Cigar Makers' International Union in 1867 became one of only two national unions to accept females to membership.[10] This policy was sometimes openly defied by union locals, however.

While the CMIU pressed for higher wages, shorter hours, better working conditions, and the right of collective bargaining, it restricted its organizing efforts to the skilled cigar roller or craftsman, requiring factory owners to reject any production of cigars by machine or to use non-union semi-skilled or unskilled labor, i.e. a closed shop.

Union labelsEdit

After 1880, Cigar manufacturers who negotiated labor contracts with the CMIU affixed blue labels to boxes of "union made" cigars made exclusively by a "First-Class Workman", i.e. hand-made. Previously, local chapters issued their own stamps including white labels, used by the Cigar Makers' Association of the Pacific Coast to show that their cigars were made by white labor, in response to the growing use of low-wage, Chinese immigrant labor. In 1875, the cigar makers' local in St Louis tried to encourage consumers to buy union-made cigars by using a red label.

The CMIU created a standard blue "union made" label in 1880 to reflect the fact that the cigars inside were made by a skilled labor union member. Union stamps underwent frequent changes and are an excellent help to collectors in the dating of cigar boxes. A "Sept. 1880" date was added top center to the label design in 1888 and appears on all CMIU cigar (not stogie) issues until 1974.

Decline and mergerEdit

About one-half of all cigar workers were represented by the CMIU in 1916, when its membership peaked at 53,000 members.[11]

In the end, the decisive blow to cigar maker unions came from technology and changing consumer preferences. As early as 1880, continued strikes, walkouts, and the steadily rising costs of labor and tobacco leaf caused U.S. tobacco companies to invest in mechanized methods of producing cigarettes and cigars. The first cigarette rolling machine was introduced in 1880 by James Albert Bonsack, while the cigar-making machine first appeared in 1889.[12][13] As demand for cigarettes increased, consumption of hand-rolled cigars declined, which directly affected CMIU members. Mechanization and unskilled cigar workers (known as "bunch breakers") increasingly replaced skilled cigar workers after World War I. Strangely, George Perkins and the CMIU leadership declined to organize semi-skilled and unskilled machine workers despite overwhelming evidence that traditional cigar-making was in steep decline; an estimated 56,000 jobs were lost between 1921 and 1935.[14] Scores of union factories went out of business, while the remainder declared an open shop.[15] By 1928, the CMIU lost much of its influence; the average CMIU member was now sixty-four years old.[16] In that year, CMIU's leadership finally agreed to unionize machine cigar workers and permit the union label on machine-finished cigars, but it was too late.[17] The Great Depression resulted in additional industry cost-cutting. By 1933, CMIU membership had declined to 15,000 members, many of them unemployed.[17] In 1931, the American Cigar Co., the only USA-based cigar factory still using hand-rolling techniques, ceased manufacture.[18]

After World War II, the consolidation of cigar manufacturing in the United States continued; many of the remaining larger manufacturing concerns moved cigar production to Central America and South America, which only accelerated the loss of union jobs.[19]

In 1974, the remaining 2,000 members of the CMIU voted to merge with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.[11][20]		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Hip-Hop Wasn’t Created by Turntable Engineers</title>

Lots of people skeptical of the idea that down the line ordinary folks could develop robots or AI.  I think they underestimate what's possible if we try to make programming more accessible.  But I also think they're missing the point:  in the long run, the most innovative work won't come from the "rocket scientists."  The best analogy for it:  the rise of hip hop.

Hip Hop came out of neighborhoods that had lost 600,000 jobs lost to outsourcing and had been ted by urban renewal. The people who first created it lived in a community that had been stripped bare, and yet out of it this amazing music rose and then transformed not just music but culture around the globe. A key part of Hip Hop’s rise was technical -- converting turntables into musical instruments -- but this technical brilliance wasn’t the result of the engineers who created turntables.

What the birth of hip-hop shows us is that to unlock the full potential of new technology, the most technically skilled people are only one small part of the story. Even where technical skill is critical, some of the most important work won’t be done by PhD’s. Grandmaster Flash, one of the “holy Trinity” who created hip-hop, had the most technical training of the three, and he’d just attended a vocational high school. But while Grandmaster Flash  wasn’t a PhD scientist, he was a mad scientist --  a genius with an obsessive drive to experiment and create something new. In short, as much as we want to spread the most technical of skills in every community, plenty of people who aren’t the most technical will still play a core role in the world of Make Creativity Work.		]]></content:encoded>

				"Grassroots power" is how organizers talk, but many people don't know what this means. So, here's my quick take:

Building grassroots power is another way of saying, when decisions are being made about who's going to get what's left of the pie, why would we only want to leave it to a handful of tech giants? we want to make sure that every community has a seat at the table.￼		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Beyond Bootcamps</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Boot camps have become increasingly popular way for folks in the community to get started in Data Science. It's understandable why. Data Science can be pretty overwhelming at first, so getting a concentrated dose with lots of support can be invaluable.

I have a tremendous amount of respect for the people who make data science boot camps happen, and they have made a huge difference in the lives of some of the people who have gone through them. But I think we are at the point where we are hitting the limits of boot camps.
(mention Code for Progress)
(frame the piece with more political economy)
(critical audience I want to move:  adult educators who think big classes is the only way to go -- and who aren't used to thinking about movement building)

First, most boot camps cost more money than many people can afford. A number of programs aimed at increasing the diversity of Data Science offer scholarships for some or all of their participants. But given how much boot camps cost to run, they can only reach a limited number of people. As a model, it just doesn't scale – and given how many data science jobs there are out there, that's a serious problem.

Similarly, most boot camps take far more time than many people can afford. Again, boot camps that try to increase the diversity of data science work very hard to help folks overcome this barrier. But for single working parents and many other people, a model built on one very concentrated dose of learning over several months just isn't going to work.

Finally, most boot camps simply can't afford to provide real support once the boot camp is over. This is an issue for a lot of folks who go through boot camps. Because no matter how dedicated the instructors are, many folks can only absorb so much info at one time. That's a problem even if you're just learning one programming language or skill. But to retain even a basic mastery of the array of skills many data science jobs require, boot camps don't offer a good answer.

So in addition to boot camps, we need another approach that can scale up. That's why Data Chefs argues for creating a continuum of tools and smooth the the learning curve among these tools . Part of the reason we need boot camps is that learning these tools is way too hard. Many of these tools are open source, and of the tools that aren't they are very interested in growing their markets. There is no reason why a movement couldn't change the trajectory of these tools to make it far easier to get started and far easier to make progress.

Similarly, there's no reason we couldn't create a more robust, community-centered ecosystem around learning and using these tools so a much wider range of folks could get exposed to them, get their feet wet, and begin to make progress at a pace that their lives could handle.

But won't this take a lot of work? Yes, it will. But so do boot camps.

Boot camps require a staggering amount of time and energy – one of the many reasons I have so much respect for the people who make them happen. For all the time and energy that go into boot camps, they can only reach a limited number of people. And for the most part, each boot camp – or school of boot camps – is an island unto itself. As a result, they never get the payoff of having many people across many communities working together towards a common goal.

So maybe it's time to think about taking some of the considerable energy going into boot camps right now and use it to build a solution that can reach a lot more people.

</a>

<blockquote>
  In a note to investors on Wednesday [July 19, 2016] Needham &amp; Company analyst Laura Martin argues that Apple (AAPL, +2.01%) could make $3 billion in revenue on Pokémon Go over the next 12 to 24 months. Martin arrived at that figure by using a wide range of data points and Apple’s 30% revenue share with developers.
  
  Just two weeks after Pokémon Go has launched, the game has achieved a 6% penetration rate in the U.S. with approximately 21 million users, Martin says. The analyst added that at its peak, the game could reach a 20% penetration rate in the countries where it’s available, which Martin says, would translate to Apple getting five cents per person per day in revenue generated from in-app purchases within the game. Pokemon Go, alone, therefore, could generate $3 billion for Apple over a 12-to-24-month period.
  
  “According to [analytics firm] Sensor Tower, on July 11 (6 days after its July 6 US launch), Pokémon Go was generating US revenue of $1.6 million per day on iOS, from the 10 million downloads on iOS devices, implying spending of $0.16 per person per day, of which Apple keeps 30% (five cents),” Martin adds in her note. “Media reports estimate conversion rates of 20%, so in reality, 20% of US users pay an average of $0.80/day and the other 80% pay nothing.”
  
  Like paid apps, Apple takes 30% of all revenue generated through in-app purchases. If the app is indeed making $1.6 million per day, Apple would be generating nearly $500,000 per day from that app alone.
</blockquote>

Let me be clear:  problem is <em>not</em> that folks at Apple, Google, etc are evil.  They're not sitting around in a lair like some James Bond villain, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSACOcLqW0c">stroking their cat</a>.

  In 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, British economist John Maynard Keynes published the essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren”.
  
  Keynes concluded that the Depression was only temporary and predicted that by 2030, people would work no more than 15 hours a week, devoting the rest of their time to leisure and culture.
  
  Keynes was right about economic growth recovering, but most of us work far more than 15 hours a week. We’re still living in a time of over-rapid changes. Technological innovation has fundamentally changed the way we work, but are we really moving toward a society where humans are free to pursue culture and leisure while enjoying an age of abundance?
  
  We Are Living In An Unprecedented Age of Change &amp; Progress
  
  <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6JjcXtpAXI0Mg4FVO2V2nQ.png" class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner">
  For the majority of human existence, we’ve made progress at an unremarkable pace, but in the last 80 years, as this chart shows, progress has exploded.
  
  Human progress can be marked by five significant revolutions, the most transformative of which occurred 50 years ago, as Yuval Noah Harari wrote in Sapiens. First was the Cognitive Revolution; about 70,000 years ago, we invented language and started to preserve knowledge. Then came the Agricultural Revolution; about 11,000 years ago, we transformed from nomadic tribes to town and city dwellers after we learned how to harness the power of nature to farm instead of forage for food. The Scientific Revolution brought Europe into the age of imperialism and rapid expansion about 500 years ago. This in turn kickstarted the Industrial Revolution, about 250 years ago and Information Revolution, about 50 years ago.
  
  Each time human history jumps forward, we’ve replaced countless jobs by inventing ways to do them better: The farmer replaced the hunter, steam engines replaced human workers. At every single point, such inventions have coincided with rapid economic growth, making the lives of humans better off as a whole.
  
  Even though we’ve demonstrably been good at replacing ourselves with machines, we still pride ourselves on being the best thinkers and decision makers on earth. Because while machines could help a farmer increase his crop yield, the ultimate decision on what to sow and when to harvest still lies on him.
  
  We believed we were the best thinkers and fastest learners on earth. But it’s no longer true.
  
  In 2016, history was made when AlphaGo became the first computer program to beat the highest ranked professional Go player, Lee Sedol, without handicaps. One reason this was so impressive is that Go is considered much more difficult than other strategy-based board games, with over 250 possible opening moves compared to chess’ 20.
  
  Machines are rapidly replicating (and improving upon) our previously unique ability to learn quickly and make decisions in reaction to changes in our environment. Eventually, machines could replace most types of jobs — including roles where the worker has to make decisions based on limited amounts of information, not just routine and predictable human labor.
  
  It’s Hard for Humans to Predict Technological Change
  
  If someone invented a time machine and transported an ordinary person from the 16th century to the 18th century, she would not, for all intents and purposes, have a hard time understanding the world. The same would not be true if someone was transported from the 18th century to the 20th century — technology has changed so quickly that she’d probably think she’d been brought to a different universe!

  The changes in outputs of key industries created a drastically different world
  The changes in outputs of key industries created a drastically different world.
  
  In the same vein, if you asked a factory worker from the 1970s if he believed that machines would eventually put him out of a job, he would find the question hard to understand, let alone answer. That’s why we must constantly question our understanding of the rate of technological progress and acknowledge that the vast majority of us are ill-equipped to make sense of it all.
  
  It’s estimated that as much as half the world’s labor could be automated over the next 20 years. There are two potential outcomes of this massive disruption of the labor market:
  
  (1) an era of mass unemployment and social instability, or
  
  (2) an age of abundance where we are free to pursue creative work
  
  Scenario 1: An Era of Social Instability
  
  In 1990, the real inflation-adjusted income of the median American household reached $54,932, but then started falling. By 2011, it had fallen nearly 10%, even as overall GDP hit a record high, according to The Second Machine Age by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee.

  In contrast, productivity grew at an average of 1.56% per year during this period, and most of this growth directly translated into comparable increases in average income. Brynjolffson and McAfee argue that median income shrank because of increases in inequality.

  Source: The Second Machine Age
  Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates , came to the same conclusion. In October 2016, Dalio evaluated the US economy by separating it into two cohorts, the top 40% and the bottom 60%.
  
  He found that the average household in the top 40% earns four times more than the average household in the bottom 60%. While the bottom 60% has experienced some recent income growth, real incomes have been flat to slightly down since 1980 (in the same time period, income has increased for the top 40%). Those in the top 40% now have on average 10 times as much wealth as those in the bottom 60%.
  
  <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ttfZU5HZXP8XecEso7MpVw.jpeg" class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner">
  Brynjolfsson and McAfee argue that the main driver of this inequality in income is the rapid downward pressure on wages for jobs that are being fully or partially replaced with automation.
  
  For example, if one hour’s worth of human labor can be done by a machine for one dollar, then under a free-market system, profit-focused employers won’t offer a wage of more than one dollar. That worker will need to settle for lower wages, and could be laid off entirely.
  
  Because digital technologies can replicate innovative ideas at low cost, a person who finds a way to leverage them will earn exponentially more than has been possible — what Brynjolfsson and McAfee call a “winner-take-all” market. For example, a relatively small number of designers and engineers could create fact-checking software. Once the software works, it can be delivered to millions of users at almost zero cost. If this software gains widespread adoption, tens of thousands of fact checkers will be put out of work while a small group of individuals capture the wealth their software created.
  
  A second important characteristic of winner-take-all markets is that individuals who create disruptive technologies don’t just get relative advantages — they win the whole market. In a traditional market, someone who was 90% as good would make 90% as much money. But in today’s market, there’s no reason to use the second-best fact-checking software when you can access the best.
  
  In this type of economy, innovators gain disproportionate wealth while reducing demand for previously important types of labor.
  
  This wealth gap will likely intensify if we fail to implement preemptive measures. In a hyperbolic scenario where technology causes mass unemployment, consumers will have less money to spend on products and services. Businesses will have to chase a shrinking pool of customers by cutting prices, sending the whole economy into a deflationary spiral.

  Scenario 2: An Age of Abundance
  
  The economic inequality that’s resulted from technological progress doesn’t show any signs of slowing, and the gap has implications beyond just differences in net worth. Another data point from Dalio’s study suggests that as differences in wealth get wider, premature deaths among the bottom 60% will also increase. We’ve already been seeing this trend from an increase in deaths associated with drug and alcohol use (up 100% since 2000) and an increase in suicides (up over 50% since 2000).
  
  Unless action is taken to reduce this inequality, it is very likely that it will only continue to rapidly worsen. It won’t be an easy path — potential solutions require major changes in social policy that can only occur through a political process and require a dramatic shift in how we distribute wealth.
  
  If policies aimed at solving this issue are successful, there’s a chance technological advancement could create an age of abundance, where we find viable solutions to mitigate the effects of a widening income gap caused by a consolidation of wealth.
  
  One possible solution to provide people with basic security is a Universal Basic Income (UBI). A country using this system would pay citizens a basic wage that is conditional on their participation in the economy. By providing people with a safety net given their participation in the economy, people are incentivized to be productive and given the means to participate in the market.
  
  Some proponents of UBI argue that we’ll be able to eliminate all social welfare programs once UBI is instituted, since those programs are just alternate ways of giving people money. One income system eliminates the need to run multiple programs side by side, reducing cost and complexity.
  
  Another potential solution is the negative income tax. Under the present tax law, we operate a positive income tax, where a household is progressively taxed after income reaches a certain cutoff point. Under a negative income tax system, a person earning less than that cutoff point has a negative taxable income of the difference between their earnings and a cutoff point. Think of the cutoff point as a mirror of progressive tax brackets — the higher a person’s total earnings are before they hit the cutoff, the less taxable income they have and the less they’ll receive from the government.
  
  This system provides a minimum income while incentivizing people to work. Research by Brynjolfsson and McAfee shows that people still stay productive if a negative income tax is in use. For example, if a cutoff point was $3,000 in annual income, someone who earned nothing could receive something like $1,500 in negative income tax and have $1,500 in total earnings for the year, but someone who earned $2,000 might receive $500 and would still end up with higher total income. This system incentivizes people to find work, even if the income for that work is low, because they still get an uplift from every dollar they make.
  
  A universal basic income or negative income tax could:
  
  Allow people to pursue work that has traditionally not been compensated well in a capitalist economy, such as community-building and social work
  Create a more progressive entrepreneurial environment by enabling people to take bigger risks in pursuing valuable work
  Help reorder social expectations. At the moment, we treat employment as a choice — but UBI and NIT treat unemployment as a market failure, not an individual one. As more and more people face being phased out of their jobs by automation, reframing how we think about work is essential to maintaining social stability.
  On top of UBI, another option is what Nobel Prize–winning conservative economist Milton Friedman termed as Negative Income Tax. Under the present tax law, we operate a Positive Income Tax, where a household is taxed on a Progressive Income Tax system above a certain cutoff point. Under a Negative Income Tax system, a person earning below the cutoff point will get a certain percentage of that difference from the government.
  A future without jobs does not equal a future without work.

  For either of these systems to work, we still have to focus on productivity, the driver of economic growth. Distributing money to be used just for consumption as a basic income rather than for improving production will diminish the value of money and stagnate the economy.
  
  Unconditional grants of money can cause demand-pull inflation to occurbecause the aggregate demand for goods and services in an economy will increase more rapidly than an economy’s production.
  
  So the key to an effective tax program would be:
  
  A cutoff point or grant amount low enough that people will still strive for more
  Grants that are only released to eligible consumers
  <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Gc0wEVrLSNoY3HHcsj4-bg.png" class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner">
  Technology like blockchain creates an unprecedented opportunity to test out decentralized decision making on resource allocation. Using a distributed ledger system to ensure money is distributed only to people who’ve done productive work, as determined by an ever-changing set of conditions or priorities monitored by an artificial intelligence engine.
  
  While we are still far away from developing general-purpose artificial intelligence, the computational tools we have at hand are already helping us make decisions on the factors that motivate different people. For example, Eitan Hersh, a political science professor at Yale University and the author of Hacking the Electorate: How Campaigns Perceive Voters studied how campaigns use big data and machine learning to mobilize voters. The algorithms developed to analyze voter behavior might be a precursor to developing more sophisticated models that predict how best to encourage participation in the economy.
  
  Ultimately, the question of whether to adopt a tax system that could help solve for growing inequality is more of a political than an economic question. It’ll be difficult to suggest the concept of ‘free money’ to a country built on the idea of free markets and fiscal conservatism. Any solution will have to blend new and existing policy, and allocate spending to training programs that can help workers be better equipped to work in a post-job economy, rather than just offering a universal payment for consumption.
  
  The fact remains that no one has all the answers, and navigating the political landscape to arrive at a solution will be an uphill battle.
  
  The policies advocated in this piece will not be easy to implement, and even if they are successfully adopted, rising inflation and decreasing wages will not be curbed immediately.
  
  The Way Forward
  
  As technology continues to progress, more traditional jobs will be threatened by automation. Any solution will involve government intervention to regulate the free-market conditions that create inequality in the first place.
  
  One potential outcome of is the call for technology to be regulated or restricted in a way so fewer jobs will be threatened. That would be a huge mistake that can happen because progress in technology is the reason why we are better off today than even just a decade ago. Research done by the team at Human Progress shows that the cost of light has fallen by a factor of 500,000, where the amount of labor that once bought 54 minutes of light now buys 52 years of light.
  
  However, the belief that the American government agreeing to tax reformers’ idea on handing out monthly checks to support a working class is a huge leap of faith.
  
  My hope is that we have to actively tap on technology to help make our lives better and if not, change the way we utilize it with small course corrections instead of halting advancements through regulation or denying UBI and negative income tax based on pre-conceived notions of what a free capital market is.
  
  The policies that are currently evaluated include:
  
  Support sectoral training, apprenticeships, and earn-while-you-learn programs.
  Implement universal pre-K, with subsidies that phase out as incomes rise.
  Raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation while raising the overtime salary threshold.
  It is likely no single solution is perfect and we have to discuss and explore a multitude of policies to create a better future. While there’s a lot of work to be done, I’m just hopeful and optimistic that the future is bright.

		<title>Robot Takes First Small Step in Dressing People</title>

More than 1 million Americans require daily physical assistance to get dressed because of injury, disease and advanced age. Robots could potentially help, but cloth and the human body are complex.

To help address this need, a robot at the Georgia Institute of Technology is successfully sliding hospital gowns on people's arms. The machine doesn't use its eyes as it pulls the cloth. Instead, it relies on the forces it feels as it guides the garment onto a person's hand, around the elbow and onto the shoulder.

The machine, a PR2, taught itself in one day, by analyzing nearly 11,000 simulated examples of a robot putting a gown onto a human arm. Some of those attempts were flawless. Others were spectacular failures -- the simulated robot applied dangerous forces to the arm when the cloth would catch on the person's hand or elbow.

From these examples, the PR2's neural network learned to estimate the forces applied to the human. In a sense, the simulations allowed the robot to learn what it feels like to be the human receiving assistance.

"People learn new skills using trial and error. We gave the PR2 the same opportunity," said Zackory Erickson, the lead Georgia Tech Ph.D. student on the research team. "Doing thousands of trials on a human would have been dangerous, let alone impossibly tedious. But in just one day, using simulations, the robot learned what a person may physically feel while getting dressed."

The robot also learned to predict the consequences of moving the gown in different ways. Some motions made the gown taut, pulling hard against the person's body. Other movements slid the gown smoothly along the person's arm. The robot uses these predictions to select motions that comfortably dress the arm.

After success in simulation, the PR2 attempted to dress people. Participants sat in front of the robot and watched as it held a gown and slid it onto their arms. Rather than vision, the robot used its sense of touch to perform the task based on what it learned about forces during the simulations.

"The key is that the robot is always thinking ahead," said Charlie Kemp, an associate professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University and the lead faculty member. "It asks itself, 'if I pull the gown this way, will it cause more or less force on the person's arm? What would happen if I go that way instead?'"

The researchers varied the robot's timing and allowed it to think as much as a fifth of a second into the future while strategizing about its next move. Less than that caused the robot to fail more often.

"The more robots can understand about us, the more they'll be able to help us," Kemp said. "By predicting the physical implications of their actions, robots can provide assistance that is safer, more comfortable and more effective."

The robot is currently putting the gown on one arm. The entire process takes about 10 seconds. The team says fully dressing a person is something that is many steps away from this work.

  Las Vegas casino workers prep for strike over automation: 'Robots can't beat us'
  Increasing automation has become a sticking point alongside other issues that could see workers bring city to a standstill

  Increasing automation has become a sticking point alongside other issues that could see workers bring city to a standstill
  
  At the Tipsy Robot in Las Vegas, a mechanical arm mixes cocktails that patrons order on tablet computers. “Galactic ambassadors” – human waitresses in shiny silver skirts – are sometimes available to deliver drinks. But the underlying message at the future-themed bar is that humans are irrelevant.
  
  It’s a novelty experience, but the future Tipsy Robot represents is one of several issues that may lead tens of thousands of Las Vegas hotel employees to strike in the coming days.
  
  The action could be a citywide resort strike, with dozens of casinos impacted.
  
  The contracts between Nevada’s largest hospitality companies – most notably MGM Resorts International – and an estimated 38,000 bartenders, cocktail servers, maids, cooks and others staff, expired 1 June. The Culinary and Bartenders Unions, which represent resort workers in the negotiations for a new five-year contract, say wage increases, workload quotas and job security threats posed by automation are the sticking points.
  
  Caesars Entertainment reached an agreement for its 12,000 union workers on Friday. But the months’ long labor talks are on pause with the other resort companies, which together account for 25 Las Vegas hotels.
  
  Strike dates have not been set, but staff at iconic properties like the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Circus Circus and The Mirage are ready to picket.
  
  This comes at one of the most lucrative moments in the strip’s recent history. The Vegas Golden Knights are skating in the Stanley Cup finals at the MGM Resorts-owned T-Mobile Arena in their inaugural season. Bars and sports books are packed with fans wearing hockey jerseys, leading some to wonder what would happen if the gambling palaces shut down.

  Of the 25,000 workers who participated in the strike vote, 99% approved the measure. In justifying demands for higher wages, Culinary pointed to the companies’ large cash flows.
  
  “We know that MGM for example is doing $3-4bn dollar buyback of stocks from their investors and we’re making the argument that workers are their best shareholders,” Bethany Khan, the Culinary Union spokeswoman, said. “We’ve been sacrificing for many years – especially during the great recession we decided to forgo wage increases so the companies could remain profitable. Now they are, so as their best investors we want a fair share of that.”
  
  If it were to last as long as the previous Las Vegas resort strike – 67 days in 1984 – Culinary estimates the work stoppage could cost MGM Resorts $200m, a heavy price to pay for a fleet of robots, which account for another hang-up in negotiations.
  
  Machines have already replaced the “change girls” who once roamed the casino floor. Since then prep cooks and bakers have seen positions dwindle due to mass food prep and commissary kitchen operations. Most recently, robot room service and digital check-in kiosks have threatened job security.
  
  “We know technology is coming, but we want to have a say in how it is implemented,” Khan said. “Be it monitoring the robot, stocking the robot, or whatever – as the jobs change inevitably workers should have opportunities to train for those new jobs. And if they can’t or won’t, they should receive generous severance packages.”
  
  Sexual harassment and safety is also a concern. The companies have tentatively agreed to provide alarm buttons to women who enter hotel rooms alone. Unions claim that management could do more to tackle aggressive sexual behavior by high rollers and other VIP clientele on the casino floor too, so the union is seeking new policies to handle those situations as well.
  
  Kayla Cinnamon, a bartender at the El Cortez, said that though she hadn’t experienced sexual harassment personally, she was willing to strike for those protections out of solidarity to other women. “It’s important we get our rights taken care of. That’s the point of having a union,” she added.

  Responding to the disputes, the casinos are keen to highlight the jobs they create.
  
  In an email statement, MGM Resorts said, “We remain dedicated to negotiating a contract that demonstrates our commitment to employees and their families while our company continues creating good jobs and future opportunities in Las Vegas.”
  
  The firm added: “We do not tolerate sexual harassment and have made a unequivocal commitment to our employees to take all necessary measures to protect them from any such behavior. MGM Resorts and the Culinary and Bartenders Unions are working on completing contract language that expresses our mutual commitment to protecting employees from workplace harassment.”
  
  Danielle Fetters, a cocktail waitress at the Mirage, said she’s anxious that the labor standoff will threaten gains already made and hopes the union settles for what’s on the table now.
  
  At the same time, Fetters and her colleagues on the casino floor are “legitimately worried” that touchscreen beverage ordering systems will soon diminish their roles serving slot machine players. That software is already being piloted in some casinos, where complimentary drinks are tied to the time and money a player spends gambling.
  
  “You used to get cigarettes and rooms and buffets and this really cool stuff,” she said.” “Now they’re so tight with everything, even though they’re making more money – and they want to get away from having cocktail waitresses? The art of customer service is completely gone. Don’t start with all this BS that you’re there for hospitality when you’re turning everything over to machines. It’s going to eliminate a lot of jobs for us, and then where do we go? This has been everything I know for my entire adult life.”

				recently, we had two different perspectives on robots and AI from folks in around the labor movement.      First, Sarita Gupta, Stephen Lerner,  and Joseph McCartin <a href="http://prospect.org/article/its-not-future-work-its-future-workers-doubt">argued</a>

<blockquote>
  The problem is not whether artificial intelligence is about to eliminate jobs; it is about as who is driving this change, why they are driving it, and whether there is any democratic accountability for how change will happen and who will be advantaged or disadvantaged by it. The fundamental question we must address is about power and who has it.
  
  Clearly, technological change holds important implications for workers and the labor movement. Yet discussions of the Future of Work as they are currently constructed threaten to become a dangerous distraction. Such discussions usually overstate and sensationalize the technological threats workers currently face, while consistently ignoring the forces that are driving the changes that most threaten workers’ security. They draw us into fruitless futuristic policy debates that divert us from addressing the nation’s most urgent needs.
  
  when even the direst warnings predict that deeply negative impacts of automation are still many years off, why do unions and progressives continue to worry about the Future of Work when our movement is facing challenges that threaten to make it an utterly marginal force by the time that future arrives?
  
  We believe that must begin with revolutionizing the tool that has been bequeathed to us by more than a century and a half of workers’ struggles—organizing through collective action and negotiating with those who control the economy and our future through collective bargaining. The form of workplace-centered organizing and bargaining that evolved over the course of the 20th century, however, is not up the challenge that workers and citizens face in this century.
  
  We need to forge new ways of organizing and bargaining appropriate to a world in which power is concentrating in the hands of fewer economic actors...
  
  We need to forge new ways of organizing and bargaining appropriate to a world in which power is concentrating in the hands of fewer economic actors; where “fissurization” has created a situation where workers’ direct employers increasingly do not have the ability to meet their demands due to the market pressures they themselves face; where financialization has altered the goals and behavior of employers, making management of private enterprise increasingly subject to fickle financial markets or the manipulations of private equity; where the public sector is being starved of resources, saddled with debt, and privatized; where the burden of taxation is being shifted away from corporations and the wealthy to the backs of working people; where concentration of wealth and power at the top is producing increasing atomization and alienation for those at the bottom; where government is either unwilling (under Republicans) or incapable (under Democrats) of enforcing labor standards or challenging and curbing corporate power
</blockquote>

Very good stuff, highly recommend you read it.

They say way too much time wasted on

<blockquote>
  Future of Work discussions tend to push us prematurely into debates on policy proposals that do not address our main problems—proposals such as the creation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI)....
  
  Third, and most important, talk of the Future of Work tends to ignore the forces that are driving the changes in our economy that are disempowering workers and concentrating income and wealth at the top. The problem is not whether artificial intelligence is about to eliminate jobs; it is about as who is driving this change, why they are driving it, and whether there is any democratic accountability for how change will happen and who will be advantaged or disadvantaged by it. The fundamental question we must address is about power and who has it.
</blockquote>

Exactly.  But that’s not an argument for not discussing it, it’s an argument for changing the terms of the debate.

Up next: an example of how to do this in the area facing the most immediate threat: long haul trucking.		]]></content:encoded>

				I started writing about robots and AI because of the threat they pose to millions of Americans' jobs and to our democracy as a whole. But now that I've been wrestling with it for a while, I realized that I've been underestimating the opportunities that this crisis provides.

Don't get me wrong – if I could wave a magic wand and make this threat go away, I would. The dangers are too great, and the amount of organizing and other hard work it's going to take to prevent us from going down a path to dysfunction or dystopia is daunting.

But in focusing on the dangers, I think I've been blind to just how big the opportunities are. So in the next couple of months, I'm going to focus on what we can fight for and not just what we have to fight against.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>First Beginning Thoughts on a New Economy</title>

				If we don't change course, our society is headed towards being dominated by one small group that owns most of the knowledge/intellectual property rights around robots/AI and another small, overlapping group that owns most of the capital.

If that happens, they'll get even more fabulously wealthy while almost unimaginable numbers of people will either be unemployed or barely making it by (as mass unemployment drives wages down).  It'll mean the end of the middle class and the rise of what I'd call a "Pharaoh-based economy," where the economy is driven by obscene consumption by the 1%. And that would also kill democracy.

But we could take a very different path:

<ul><li> We could democratize knowledge about robots/AI, 3-D printing, wearables, the Internet of Things, etc. as much as possible</li>
<li> We could change the rules of the system from a winner take all economy to one that favors diversity, rebuilding our communities from Harlem to Harlan County -- and in doing so create the most powerful, innovative economy the world has ever seen </li></ul>

I think this new economy, what I call the Makers All economy, would rest on four pillars:

<ul><li>Universal Benefits &amp; Basic Income (UBBI)</li>
<li> The Attention Economy (Making Intellectual Property)</li>
<li> Making Community</li>
<li> The Rest of the Market</li></ul>

Right now the beginning framework I have in my head is so misty/inchoate I can't sum up each pillar in a few words -- and they need better names. So in the next few blog posts I'll start fleshing out each pillar and see if I can turn them into a v0.1.		]]></content:encoded>

				One of the concerns that some critics have about a Universal Basic Income is the impact it might have on people's desires to do anything – that too many people would end up sitting around in their underwear, playing video games all day long. Although that hasn't been the experience with UBI pilot project so far, I do think it's worth talking about how to structure the economy so it'll encourage people to not fall down that hole.  But I think part of the reason why critics have this concern is that they're underestimating just how dramatically our world is going to change.

For a pilot project at work, I've been boning up on Microsoft's Hololens, an "augmented reality" set of goggles that let you see and interact with holograms in the middle of your everyday surroundings. After three decades I'm pretty jaded about new tech, but I'm having trouble not giggling every time I watch a demo. It reminds me of when I first started programming—it feels like magic. And it's just the beginning: 3-D printing, wearables, the Internet of Things are going to create a pretty amazing world of possibilities.

I don't think it's going to be that hard to convince most people who are spending the time UBI would give them doing more "productive" work to play by themselves and with other people in this new world of tech. Our motto: would you rather play a Wizard or be a Wizard?		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Talking Points: a Shitty First Draft</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Finally, I've got a pretty good idea of what Makers All stands for. But I can't seem to explain it in less than 20 to 30 minutes. So, here's <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf">shitty first draft</a> of my talking points.

Sometime between 2025 and 2040, many experts believe that 30-70% of all jobs will be eliminated by robots/AI. How does our society survive this threat?

Makers All argues that we can not only survive but thrive if we follow 3 strategies:

<h2>1) Make a Floor</h2>

Give everyone a Universal Basic Income so that no one starves, everyone benefits from the bounty of wealth created by this new economy, and everyone has room to take more risks – to start a small business/co-op, to pursue their dreams.

Most discussions of the robots/AI unemployment threat stop here. But it isn't enough. A basic income would leave millions still scraping to get by on a fraction of their old income without any real hope for a better financial future for themselves or their children. And in an economy where more and more of the wealth and power would be accumulated at the top, it isn't politically sustainable. To solve this crisis, we need 2 more strategies:

<h2>2) Make Creativity Work</h2>

A.K.A. Spotify/YouTube Done Right
In an economy increasingly dominated by robotics/AI, 3-D printing, wearables, etc. the biggest value doesn't come from what we physically own but from intellectual property and ideas – the ideas behind a robot's sensor, the code that makes it run, the recipe the robot can cook, the diagram a 3-D printer uses to print something. If these creative works are freely/cheaply available, everybody benefits – but then if few who create them can make a living. So what we need to do is create a system where

<ul>
<li>Everyone has a shot at earning all or some of their income when they add creative works that plenty of people find useful – in short, Spotify/YouTube done right.</li>
<li>From Harlem to Harlan County, we need to ensure that every community learns how to use this new technology, both so that people in their community can benefit from their creativity and so that they understand enough of how the nuts and bolts of this new economy work so they can have a real voice in setting the rules that determine who benefits from this new wealth</li>
</ul>

If instead of writing off or abandoning more and more communities, we create a people-powered economy where everyone from every community can participate and share in the benefits, we will create an economy that is not only more just but also create an unprecedented amount of wealth.

<h2>3) Make Community Work</h2>

Make Creativity Work will give many more chance to participate in this new economy, but for many people both it and Universal Basic Income still won't be enough to guarantee that everyone who is willing and able to work hard to have a solid middle class life. Make Creativity Work is where people make money because we vote for work we like/use; with Make Community Work we get to vote for income for what the work we value that doesn't get captured by it.

<ul>
<li>Make Community Work offer people a chance to supplement their income by taking care of their children or the elderly, by volunteering (e.g., Volunteer Bucks), by participating in making their community more resilient in a world wracked by climate change, etc. how much of a mix of additional income for specific projects vs., say, volunteering would depend on what mix we decide to support when we deliberate and vote.</li>
<li>To really Make Community Work, we would want to create a Continuum of participation, from locally-oriented Voter Kickstarters/<a href="http://issuu.com/streetplanscollaborative/docs/tactical_urbanism_vol_2_final">tactical urbanism</a> to regional <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/">Participatory Budgeting</a> (e.g.,a participatory budgeting-style <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA">DARPA</a>) to full-blown Representative democracy. The goal would be to create lots of room for folks in the communities to learn through experimenting and innovating at a smaller scale while still offering spaces for the choices that we can only make when we choose together</li>
<li>As the robots/AI unemployment crisis begins to really take off, it won't hit every community equally – wiping out most truck drivers will create some problems in big cities but will decimate small rural towns. So we will need something like a Marshall Plan to both help communities that are flattened by new economic crises and help communities that have never recovered from previous ones.</li>
</ul>

Okay, a bit of a hot mess, but a decent place to start! Rather than trying to refine them now, I'm going to step back and work on clarifying what is a problem I think we need to solve. Not only will clarifying the problem help me clean up the talking points, but there's also a really good chance that my answer isn't ultimately the right one. And right now I think the most important thing we can do is to get folks thinking &amp; talking beyond the very narrow confines of Universal Basic Income, so getting the question(s) right is way more important than getting the right answer.		]]></content:encoded>

				Here's a first cut at the features that I think any solution to the robots/AI unemployment crisis needs to include:

<ol>
<li>Focuses Not on Jobs For All But on Income and Security For All</li>
<li>Focuses Not Just on Individuals but on Communities</li>
<li>Builds Grassroots Power</li>
<li>Still Worth Doing Even If Crisis Happens Much Later</li>
<li>Wherever Possible, Promotes Experimenting &amp; Testing Out Ideas </li>
</ol>

In upcoming posts, I'll flesh out these five features -- and in doing so, hopefully, tighten up the wording.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is Makers All Still Worth Worrying about Right Now?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I am still reeling from Trump's election.  When I think about what he and the Republicans are going to do -- the lives that will be destroyed by mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and the targeting of Muslims, the people who are going to die because they'll lose their health insurance, the rollback of Roe v Wade -- the list of truly awful things that are likely to happen is so long I can't think about it without shutting down in despair and rage.  Even worse:  if our side doesn't succeed, what might come next after eight years of Trump.

In the middle of this disaster, the idea of spending time on dangers that may happen in 2025 or 2040  has been feeling like a complete waste of time.  So I've been struggling with what part of the new fights I want to join instead.

Two things changed my mind.

First, as folks have been sorting through the wreckage of the election, one thing's become clear:  one big factor in Clinton losing was that a good chunk of white working class voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin voted for Obama but didn't vote for her.  Yes, racism is definitely a major, critical part of the story.  But their despair about their community's economic future was also a very big part.

Put aside what might happen to them by 2040.  In 8 years -- or two terms of Trump -- there's a good chance that robots/AI will start  <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/8/3/12342764/autonomous-trucks-employment">wiping out the 1.8 million jobs in the long haul trucking industry</a>.  In an  <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state">amazing number of states</a>, these truck driving jobs are most available good paying blue collar job left.  And when most of them vanish, it's going to also devastate a lot of small and rural communities as all the jobs it supports, from mechanics to waitresses to motel clerks, go with it.  I doubt most of these jobs will be gone by the 2024 election.  But the writing's going to be on the wall.

And the folks in those communities who voted this time or Trump out of desperation and anger?  How do you think they'll feel in 8 years, when Trump's going to have failed them?  As bad as Trump is going to be, we could be looking at someone much, much worse two Presidential elections from now if our side isn't paying any attention.

Second, on election day the UN came out with a  <a href="http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/presspb2016d6_en.pdf">report</a> that says that up to  <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/robots-will-take-two-thirds-of-all-jobs-in-the-developing-world-un-says">two thirds of all jobs in the developing world</a> are likely to get wiped out by robot/AI automation.  This is about the most grim forecast that any major official body has made.  On a topic like this, I would've expected the UN to be a lot more cautious.  If they're making this kind of projection today, they've got to be pretty confident about their numbers.

I have my doubts about their forecast.  There are so many manual jobs in the informal economy in developing countries that won't be easy to automate for quite some time that two thirds seems pretty high to me.  But even if the overall number is too high, one thing's for sure: they're pretty confident that a lot of the best blue collar jobs that have helped many developing economies succeed are going to be wiped out.  And given how mumbly their conclusions were, they don't seem to have a clue about what developing countries will be able to do about it.

I'm not going to stick with my original plans of putting all of my time and focus on the future; there are going to be too many critical fights that will be happening right now to save as much as we can from Trump and the Republicans' onslaught.  But as hard as it is to worry about anything other than the horrific crisis right in front of our faces, at least somebody on our side also needs to be spending some time thinking about the potentially even worse disaster a few steps ahead. Given that I've got another 1-2 years before my knees injury will have healed enough that I can be seriously politically active, that somebody might as well be me.		]]></content:encoded>

				A quick update:  I've been spending a bunch of time wrestling with talking points, and I'm feeling a bit stuck (or Trumped).  So, a quick dump of my current summary of Makers All.  It's a bit of a hot mess, but the editing part of my brain seems to have left for Christmas extra early, so at this point I just need to get it out of my head.

<h2>The Problem:</h2>

Some experts believe that between 2025 and 2040, 25-75% of all jobs will be eliminated by robots/AI. If we don't act, this crisis could end up destroying the middle class and the poor and potentially our democracy itself.  But because this crisis will turn upside down a lot of our assumptions about how the market works, it's also a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rethink our economy.  So, how can we take on this crisis and create a more just, prosperous economy everywhere from Harlem to Harlan County?

<h2>Universal Basic Income  Isn't the Solution</h2>

Most folks have been coalescing around Universal Basic Income (UBI) -- giving everyone a yearly basic income of $12,000 or so -- as the answer.  UBI has a lot of advantages as one piece of a solution:  it would prevent anyone from starving, and it would give everyone a cushion that would give them the freedom to spend some time however they choose, from volunteering to taking the risk of creating a small business or coop.  But by itself, UBI isn't the whole answer.

<ul>
<li>Advocates haven't come to terms with the magnitude of the change robots/AI are bringing with them.  In a world where massive numbers of people will never have a job and the number will only continue to grow, telling all these people that they and probably their children can look forward to for the rest of their lives is living on just $12,000/year is not a real answer.</li>
<li>In a world where the 1% already have way too much power, UBI keeps economic power in the hands of a few. This is a recipe for disaster -- especially in a world where the 1% will feel more and more like they are embattled "makers" in a world of parasitic "takers."  </li>
</ul>

If UBI isn't the right solution, what does the answer need to accomplish?

<ul>
<li>How do we make sure that everyone -- not just some individuals but all communities -- benefit financially from this new economy and ensure that, unlike economic transformations in the past, no one is left out?</li>
<li>Like UBI, we want to take advantage of automating drudgery away and create more freedom so that both individuals and their communities will be able to help steer their destinies?</li>
<li>How do we build grassroots power, especially at the core of the economy?  And do it in a way that gives pride in ownership -- that we are all makers, that we all make the economy work?</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Solution: Makers All</h2>

Makers All has 2 parts:  Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work

<h3>1)  Make Creativity Work</h3>

The Net has fostered an unprecedented bottom up outpouring of creative works, and yet it's harder than ever for anyone not at the top of the game o pay the bills doing it.  Journalists, musicians, songwriters, photographers  -- they're all struggling to survive.  Meanwhile the real money goes to the toll collectors -- the tech companies that freely give away their stuff to sell ads, record label insiders, patent trolls, etc who all use the government-shaped rules of the road to make sure they get paid.  This is going to be even more of an issue as not only robots and AI but also technology like 3D printing, wearables, biohacking, etc become the driving forces of the economy:  these are all tech where the most valuable part isn't, say, an individual robot but the creative works-- patents, copyrighted software etc .  -- that let you build &amp; program the robot, create a 3D printed thingee, etc.

The solution:  Make Creativity Work

A) Create an "Attention Economy," a.k.a.  YouTube/Spotify Done Right

<ul>
<li>Create a free/inexpensive system that lets everyone share in creative bounty and pays creators real $$ based on who uses it</li>
</ul>

B) Make "Attention Economy" Production Accessible to All Communities

<ul>
<li>Smooth the Learning Curve:  design Robots/3DP/etc and the tools &amp; ecosystem around them so it's easy to start "coding", easy to "level up" as you need to </li>
<li>Organize in Communities: avoid the mistake of the Net, which promised it would empower everyone but left many communities behind. Create a network of organizing ___in all communities so that every community benefits and so that there are enough people in every community who understand this new world and have built enough grassroots power so that every community has a seat at the table.</li>
</ul>

The End Result: we will unleash massive creativity and wealth that every community will benefit from.

<h3>2) Make Communities Work</h3>

Although every community should benefit from the Attention Economy, not every individual will benefit enough to pay the bills, and not everything we value will make money in the Attention Economy. So we will need another way to make sure nobody starves and everyone has a shot at making it. So:
A) We Will Need the Government to:

<ul>
<li>Make a Floor: Universal Basic Income for all: nobody starves, everyone benefits from society's bounty</li>
<li>Provide resources for what the market doesn't value -- $$for taking care of kids/elderly, "volunteer bucks", grants for making communities resilient, etc.</li>
<li>If a community is hit hard by current crisis or left behind in previous crises, create a Marshall Plan-style transition</li>
<li>Everyone Gets to Help Write the Rules of the two:  e.g., setting up the payment structure of the Attention Economy so it isn't winner takes all and so there's more room for "mid-list" successes</li>
<li>Getting Fledgling Markets Off the Ground, Paying for things that Market doesn't value like roads, etc.</li>
</ul>

B) Create a Continuum of Participation In a Way That Builds Community Power &amp; Experience at Actually Governing
{need to better explain why I think this is so critical – for innovation, for giving people a feeling of being more involved in the government and having more control, less alienated, and from more room for bottom-up experimentation that we can learn from -- getting the best of both worlds {

<ul>
<li>Small Group Experiments: Tactical Urbanism / Voter Kickstarter</li>
<li>Participatory Budgeting on Steroids (ex: DARPA PB)</li>
<li>Representative Democracy</li>
</ul>		]]></content:encoded>

				My latest list of the features that any solution to the robot/AI-driven unemployment crisis needs to address.

<ol>
<li>Works both for individuals and communities</li>
<li>Creates security -- nobody falls through the cracks and everyone has a real shot at building a decent life -- and fosters innovation</li>
<li>Builds Grassroots Power at the Core of the Economy</li>
<li>Because the future is unknowable, the solution still needs to be worth doing if the crisis happens later &amp; it needs to promote testing out ideas</li>
</ol>		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Amazon&#039;s Latest Patent Shows Why Today&#039;s Automation Is Different</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/amazons-latest-patent-shows-why-todays-automation-is-different/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				From the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/technology/detailing-amazons-custom-clothing-patent.html">New York Times</a>:

<blockquote>In April, Amazon received an intriguing patent for an “on demand” apparel manufacturing system, which can quickly fill online orders for suits, dresses and other garments.</blockquote>

Amazon -- the people who started out selling books online and now sell everything from network cables to cable knit sweaters -- is now considering using robots to make some of the clothes they sell. &nbsp;And that, boys and girls, is Exhibit A why the argument that we don't have to worry about robots/AI because &nbsp;hasn't created mass unemployment in the past doesn't hold water.

Suppose I told you that John Deere was going to automate some of the garment making business. &nbsp;You'd think that was a little weird, right? &nbsp;Until recently, most automation was industry specific: &nbsp;just because you could automate harvesting wheat didn't mean you could automate harvesting numbers -- aka spreadsheets -- or making clothes.&nbsp;

But now the tech that, say, analyzes cat pictures online may end up driving a wide variety of vision systems. &nbsp;So it's a much smaller leap from running a massive online store like Amazon to making drones to making clothes. &nbsp;Amazon's patent may automate only some parts of the process, and undoubtedly it'll only cover some types of clothing. &nbsp; But the speed at which automation has the potential to cross different types of industries and types of work is a little scary.

Or to put it another way: &nbsp;the mechanization of wheat harvesting took off roughly in the 1930s and 40s, but it wasn't until the late 1960s that tomato harvesting took off. &nbsp;Anybody expect it'll take Amazon 20+ years to go from building drones to automating the manufacturing of some garments?

And that's why we need to be worried. &nbsp;In the era of John Deere automation, we could count on &nbsp;new jobs being created frequently enough to replace the jobs that had been automated away. &nbsp;But as the speed of automation is starting to accelerate, it is a risky bet to assume that new job creation will keep pace.

<hr>

Update: how serious is Amazon about AI and robots? &nbsp;According to <a href="https://blog.equinix.com/blog/2016/07/25/artificial-intelligence-as-a-service-can-make-the-enterprise-smarter/">one analysis</a> of Amazon's recent acquisitions and other signs of their intent, Amazon is &nbsp;"seeking to become the central provider for AI-as-a-service," where anyone could tap into Amazon's AI offerings rather than having to build it out themselves.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How Do We Make UBI Work?  Move All Those Big City Folk to Detroit!</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/how-do-we-make-ubi-work-move-all-those-big-city-folk-to-detroit/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2017 17:02:38 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[aschneiderman]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://makersall.org/?p=187</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I finally found a UBI advocate who explains how people in the US would be able to make ends meet on the paltry amount most UBI plans offer. &nbsp;Albert Wenger, the former President of del.icio.us and a managing partner at a NYC venture capital firm, is writing a book online called <a href="https://worldaftercapital.gitbooks.io/worldaftercapital/content/part-three/Economic.html">The World After Capital</a>, and one of its main arguments is that we'll need a UBI. &nbsp;In his version, each adult would get $1,000 a month. Here's how they'd spend it:

<blockquote>&nbsp;The likely cost allocation for a typical adult would roughly break down as follows: [$300/month] for housing, [$300/month] for food, [$100/month] for transportation, [$50/month] for internet access and associated equipment ... [this needs more work and backup].</blockquote>

Given that it's not 1980, how does he think most adults will get enough housing for $300/month? &nbsp;First, all the new fangled technology will make building housing cheap.

<blockquote>we need to look at how technology is presently driving down the prices of everything — a process known to economists as “technological deflation.” Technology can make education and health care far more affordable than it is today....

What about shelter? Technology is definitely making it cheaper to put up a building. We now even have the beginnings of houses that are produced in a fully automated way using 3D printers!</blockquote>

Second, buy a lot of folks a bus ticket:

<blockquote>It of course still costs a ton of money to live in certain places like Manhattan or San Francisco, since demand for housing space exceeds the available supply. Here UBI functions quite differently from other solutions that make housing more affordable, such as government subsidies. With UBI, people can live in parts of the country (or the world) where housing is much more affordable.

The city of Detroit is currently giving away houses as an alternative to tearing them down. Or if you prefer a rural setting, you can rent a cottage in North Carolina for only $995/month [40]. Right now, many people can't take advantage of these opportunities, since they can't find a job in these locales and would be left with no income. By breaking the connection with a job, UBI makes geographic flexibility possible. People would no longer be geographically trapped by the challenge of providing for their basic needs.</blockquote>

How many people are we talking? &nbsp;Well, in April there were <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/national-rent-data/">39 major cities in the US</a> where the median rent for a one bedroom apartment was over $1,000/mo, aka the total amount provided by his UBI. &nbsp;That's a lotta bus tickets.

Luckily, getting all those folks to move to Detroit and other super affordable cities wouldn't make those cities' land &amp; housing prices skyrocket, because... he doesn't say. &nbsp;

But at least <a href="https://detroit.curbed.com/2017/1/5/14179318/detroit-rent-increase-2016">Detroit</a>&nbsp;housing is dirt cheap today. &nbsp;Or not:

<blockquote>in Detroit, the average rental price for a one-bedroom was $620 (that’s all Detroit - not just downtown, not metro Detroit). That price fluctuated from a low of $602 in May/June [2016], to a spike in December of $725.</blockquote>

It's clear from the rest of the book that Wenger is a decent person who sincerely wants to find a way out of the crisis we're facing. &nbsp;And it certainly makes sense to ask how we can help bring down the &nbsp;cost of living in the future so that a UBI would go farther. &nbsp;But betting a UBI-centric strategy on blithely assuming eventually it'll all work out is just as likely to create the conditions for the kind of despair that leads to fascism as it is to deliver a happy ending.		]]></content:encoded>

				Recently, the Merlin Network, the main indie label digital rights agency, released a survey of their members.  <a href="http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/06/12/merlin-spotify-more-youtube/">According</a> to Digital Music News, there's good news and bad news.  The good news: although income from audio streaming is still pretty sad, it's increased considerably.

<blockquote>Boosted by a “significant uptake” in audio streaming, the global digital rights agency’s payouts have increased 52% year-on-year.  Revenues paid out have increased more than eightfold....

Underscoring the strength of music streaming in the music industry, the report reads,&nbsp;“Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Merlin members report that audio streaming accounts for the majority of their digital revenues.  This marks a significant leap from 2016, when less than half (46%) said this was the case.”

However, while audio streaming services like Spotify provide major revenue for Merlin members, video streaming has significantly underperformed.  The global digital rights agency saw “only negligible growth from video streaming.”</blockquote>

As a result, there is now a staggering gap between audio streaming and video.

<blockquote>“Audio streaming growth outstrips video 3-to-1 as distributions to independent labels hit $353m.”&nbsp;</blockquote>

The main reason for this discrepency:  YouTube.

<blockquote>the latest IFPI report shows that user-uploaded video platforms [YouTube] have only paid out $553 million to rightsholders.  The Google-owned video platform commands an audience of over 900 million users.  By contrast, on-demand audio streaming services generated $3.9 billion with just 212 million users.</blockquote>

Industry critics argue that YouTube pays far less than it should, primarily through the creative use of legal loopholes. &nbsp;Last year, over 180 musical artists from Lady Gaga to Ne-Yo <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/youtube-fight-steps-lady-gaga-sir-paul-mccartney-go-anti-dcma/">signed on to an open letter</a> to Congress,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/revealed-the-186-artists-protesting-against-youtube-shielding-dmca-laws/">charging</a> that major tech players like YouTube were using loopholes in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to rip off artists.

<blockquote>This law was written and passed in an era that is technologically out-of-date compared to the era in which we live. It has allowed major tech companies to grow and generate huge profits by creating ease of use for consumers to carry almost every recorded song in history in their pocket via a smartphone, while songwriters’ and artists’ earnings continue to diminish. Music consumption has skyrocketed, but the monies earned by individual writers and artists for that consumption has plummeted.

The DMCA simply doesn’t work. It’s impossible for tens of thousands of individual songwriters and artists to muster the resources necessary to comply with its application. The tech companies who benefit from the DMCA today were not the intended protectorate when it was signed into law nearly two decades ago.</blockquote>

And that, boys and girls, is another example of why any solution to the robot/AI employment threat must ensure we build grassoots power at the heart of this new economy.  Small changes in the rules governing creative works can make a huge difference in who makes money off of these works and who doesn't.  And economic leverage can also make a real difference: one main reason why audio streaming is doing so well, Digital Music News, is that Spotify wants to have a successful IPO.

<blockquote>As it pushes ahead with its IPO plans, Spotify has settled major lawsuits and attempted to pay out more.&nbsp;</blockquote>

If we want all communities to benefit from the coming economy, we need to ensure that at least some people in every community has an in-the-trenches understanding of how this new economy works, and every community needs the economic and political power to guarantee a real seat at the table.		]]></content:encoded>

				An engineer with Rolls Royce who's working on self-driving ships <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/marine/forget-autonomous-cars-autonomous-ships-are-almost-here">says</a> they're likely to become a reality before self-driving cars, starting with ferries.

<blockquote>My colleagues and I at Rolls-Royce anticipate that the first commercial vessel to navigate entirely by itself could be a harbor tug or a ferry designed to carry cars the short distance across the mouth of a river or a fjord and that it or similar ships will be in commercial operation within the next few years. And we expect fully autonomous oceangoing cargo ships to be routinely plying the world’s seas in 10 or 15 years’ time.</blockquote>

What I've always wondered is, what about pirates? &nbsp;Wouldn't self-driving ships be really vulnerable? &nbsp; He says&nbsp;no.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<blockquote>The threat posed by piracy to ships and their crews would also be reduced. That’s because uncrewed ships could be built so that they’d be very difficult to board on the high seas. Even if pirates got aboard, access to the controls could be made unavailable. Indeed, the computers in command could immobilize the ship or have it steam in a circle, making it relatively easy for naval authorities to reach it. Recapture would also be easier than is usually the case in such situations because there would be no crew held hostage. And without a captured crew to ransom, the target of the piracy is significantly less valuable.</blockquote>

I can see it now: a pirate ship appears on the horizon, and a convoy of robot ships and their drones immediately begin to steam in circles in a&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/kIO9y1xMPIA">Busby Berkeley</a> musical number,  "I Only Have Eyes For You" blaring from their loudspeakers as they call in the authorities.

The reality, of course, would probably be closer to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi2544501017">Gone in 60 Seconds</a>; never underestimate the ability of thieves to adapt to a new mouse trap.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Universal Basic Income Isn&#039;t Enough</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/why-universal-basic-income-isnt-enough/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Ask an expert who's worried about jobs being automated away by robots/AI what we should do, and almost all of them will say, create a Universal Basic Income. When millions of Americans can't count on being able to find a job, at a minimum we need to make sure nobody starves. And Universal Basic Income has a lot of other advantages. It gives people more freedom – they can decide to spend their time volunteering, creating a small business or co-op, etc. it would give more people the kind of financial cushion they need to create a startup business or co-op. It would strengthen the leverage of workers who still have a job – treat people like crap and they can walk away because they know they have a cushion.

But Universal Basic Income isn't just the beginning of the conversation about what we should do. Most of the time, it's also the end of it. And that's a problem, because although UBI will undoubtedly be a piece of the solution, it's not enough.

<h2>1) Universal Basic Income is too Basic</h2>

Sometimes it feels like UBI advocates forget the "basic" part of Universal Basic Income. Most UBI proposals would give every adult citizen around $10,000 a year. If you're trying to prevent people from falling into poverty, that's not bad. But if millions of Americans are losing their jobs and have little or no hope of getting a good paying job in the future, will they really think $10,000 a year – or $20,000 a year if they are married – is enough? Considering that <a href="http://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/acsbr15-02.pdf">median household income</a> in the Atlanta metro region is around $60,000 a year and in Baltimore, Seattle, Denver, Minneapolis, Denver, and Boston it's over $70,000 a year, is this at all realistic? Especially when we aren't talking about a cushion to get folks through a temporary crunch but rather for the rest of their lives and their children's lives?

<h2>2) Universal Basic Income isn't Politically Sustainable -- And Could Lead to Much Worse</h2>

Some advocates think Universal Basic Income will be politically sustainable because Silicon Valley is into it right now, others because elites are afraid of the alternative – peasants with pitchforks.

But remember Romney's "makers  vs. takers"? The takers he was talking about were mostly people who work hard in really low-wage jobs. Now imagine a world in which more and more Americans have no hope of ever having a job or otherwise officially contributing to the production of the economy – Ayn Rand's worst nightmare. How do you think the elites, who are already convinced today that they are the engine that keeps the economy running, will react to that? Assuming that they will simply accept it seems like a very risky bet. At a minimum, they would seem just as likely to use every pretext – such as the constant weather crises due to climate change – to chip away at it. And it could just as easily go in a very scary direction: if we have far more people than jobs, a handful of elites might decide that maybe the problem isn't too few jobs, it's too many people.

 

<h2>3) Universal Basic Income Doesn't Address the Balance of Economic Power</h2>

The biggest problem with Universal Basic Income is that it doesn't address the growing imbalance of power between the 1% and everyone else. In an economy where more and more of the wealth, power, and critical skills/knowledge that will be accumulated at the top, this is not a recipe for success. If the last few decades have taught us anything, it's that our solution to the robot/AI unemployment crisis needs to change the balance of power by increasing the economic power of everyday Americans.		]]></content:encoded>

				An interesting <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/607894/why-googles-ceo-is-excited-about-automating-artificial-intelligence/?imm_mid=0f1bb0&amp;cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_ai_20170522">development</a> from Google's dev conference: &nbsp;

<blockquote>Pichai introduced a project called AutoML coming out of the company’s Google Brain artificial intelligence research group. Researchers there have shown that their learning algorithms can automate one of the trickiest parts of the job of designing machine-learning software to take on a particular task....

On the image task, their system rivaled the best architectures designed by human experts. On the language task, it beat them.

Perhaps more significantly, it came up with architectures of a kind that researchers didn’t previously consider suited to those tasks. “In a sense it found something we didn’t know about,” says Le. “It’s striking.”</blockquote>

But it's a ways from being a threat to developers' jobs -- at least for now...

<blockquote>When asked if they are on track to put themselves out of a job, Le and Zoph laugh, though. Right now the technique is too expensive to be widely used. The pair’s experiments tied up 800 powerful graphics processors for multiple weeks—racking up the kind of power bill few companies could afford for speculative research.

Still, Google now has a larger team working on AutoML, including on how to make it less resource-intensive.&nbsp;</blockquote>		]]></content:encoded>

				It's a really good thing few people make a living playing Go, because Google's AlphaGo just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/business/google-deepmind-alphago-go-champion-defeat.html">stomped the best player in the world</a>, in no small part because it's been getting better at a remarkable rate.

<blockquote>Mr. Ke, who smiled and shook his head as AlphaGo finished out the game, said afterward that his was a “bitter smile.” After he finishes this week’s match, he said, he would focus more on playing against human opponents, noting that the gap between humans and computers was becoming too great. He would treat the software more as a teacher, he said, to get inspiration and new ideas about moves.

“AlphaGo is improving too fast,” he said in a news conference after the game. “AlphaGo is like a different player this year compared to last year.”</blockquote>

How good has AlphaGo gotten?

<blockquote>“Last year, it was still quite humanlike when it played,” said Mr. Ke after the game. “But this year, it became like a god of Go.”</blockquote>

Not scary at all.		]]></content:encoded>

				<i>Finally, a new version of the framework! The language is pretty rough but I wanted to get it out there so I can start getting feedback.</i>

Many experts believe that between 2025 and 2040, 25-75% of all jobs will be replaced by robots/AI. Given that the rules of our economy already concentrate wealth and power at the top, this crisis could end up devastating the middle class and the poor and destroying our democracy. The question we need to answer is, how do we:

<ul>
<li>survive this crisis</li>
<li>use it as an opportunity to build a more just, prosperous economy</li>
<li>ensure that our strategy pays off even if this crisis doesn't occur by 2040</li>
</ul>

To succeed, first we need to better understand our values -- what do we want this new economy to provide, what kind of behavior do we want this economy's rules to reward? To do so, we can draw lessons from 2 of the most important recent economic eras:  the Mass Consumer Economy of the 1940s-1960s and the Information Economy of the 1990s-2010s.

<h3>1) Security</h3>

When we talk about security, what most people implicitly have in mind is what the Mass Consumer Economy provided white middle class and upper working-class families:  any man who was willing and able to work hard could easily get a good paying job that a family could live on, good benefits, and a home at an affordable price.

<h3>2) Creativity</h3>

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, even as African-Americans and others' fight to gain access to this new security was beginning to pay off,  many people were starting to ask to ask, is this all there is?  Now that for the first time in history large numbers of people no longer had to worry about how they would survive, they began to raise questions about why couldn't their job offer both security and be more fulfilling, offering them the opportunity to express their full humanity?

The Information Economy gave us a glimpse of what a world of more fulfilling work might look like. It has created an explosion of creativity online, ranging from photos to cooking videos to open-source software. And for a lucky few, it's also provided the freedom to do a more interesting mix of work via the new "gig economy."

But while the Information Economy created far more room for creativity than the Mass Consumer Economy did, it offered fewer and fewer workers the kind of security offered by the Mass Consumer Economy. In fact, for many of the most creative workers -- songwriters, newspaper reporters -- the Information Economy made it much harder to earn a living.

In our future economy, where robots/AI, 3D printing, wearables, etc. will be ubiquitous, creativity won't just be desirable, it will also play a central role.  What makes a robot valuable isn't the physical robot itself, it's the creative works that drive it -- the cooking recipe, the software that governs what the robot's arm can do, the patent behind its sensors.  And as robots/AI eliminate more and more drudgery, this opens up even more opportunities to shift the balance of work in the economy more towards creative work.

So the question we face in this coming economy is, how can we find a way to combine the best of the Information Economy and the Mass Consumer Economy, offering both creativity and security -- and unlike either previous era, how can we make them accessible to every community? The answer:  Makers All.

<h2>The Makers All Economy</h2>

Makers All consists of 2 strategies:

<strong>Make Creativity Work</strong>
In a world where robots/AI, 3D printing, wearables, etc. become ubiquitous, build an economy where in every community, as many individuals as possible have a shot at earning income from creative work.

<ul>
<li>Create a free/inexpensive system that lets everyone share in the creative bounty and pays creators real $$ based on who uses what they created -- a.k.a. "YouTube Done Right."</li>
<li>Create institutions that ensure that every community has ample opportunity for as many individuals as possible to learn the skills they need to participate in this economy -- and "smooth the learning curve" by designing robots/3D printing machines/etc and the tools &amp; ecosystems around them so it's easy to start "coding", easy to gain more skill as you need it</li>
<li>Organize in communities: avoid the mistake of the Internet, which promised it would empower everyone but left many communities behind. Foster organizing in communities so that every community benefits and so there are enough people in every community who understand this new world and have built enough grassroots power so that every community has a seat at the table.</li>
<li>Everyone gets to help write the rules of the road:  e.g., setting up the payment structure so it isn't winner takes all and so there's more room for "mid-list" successes</li>
</ul>

The End Result: we will unleash massive creativity and wealth that will benefit every community in the US.  If we do it right, this approach could also scale globally, making an enormous difference in lives of workers around the world.

<strong>Make Community Work</strong>
Although every community should benefit from Make Creativity Work, not everyone will benefit enough to pay the bills, and not everything we value will pay. So we will need another way to make sure nobody starves and everyone has a shot at making it:

<ul>
<li>To guarantee everyone security, create a backstop. It could be a mix of small amount of Universal Basic Income and other opportunities to earn additional income that anyone can do and that reinforce the work our society values -- e.g., "volunteer bucks."</li>
<li>Provide resources for what the market doesn't value -- e.g., income for taking care of kids/elderly and other work traditionally done by women that our society hasn't valued -- and helping fledgling markets get off the ground</li>
<li>Create a continuum of participation that give people more hands-on involvement and that combine the best of bottom-up experimentation with the need to make some choices that we can only choose together.  This could include small group experiments (e.g., "Voter Kickstarters", <a href="http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/about/">Tactical Urbanism</a>)  and  regional opportunities (eg., funding innovation ala DARPA through regional <a href="https://www.participatorybudgeting.org/what-is-pb/">participatory budgeting</a>)</li>
<li>If a community is hit hard by current crisis or left behind in previous crises, create a Marshall Plan-style transition</li>
</ul>

<h2>History Shows Us How to Make This Work</h2>

It isn't too hard to imagine how Make Community Work could operate. The most serious concern is how we would pay for it. There's a pretty straightforward answer:  if Make Creativity Work is successful, it should generate more than enough wealth  that could be taxed to pay for Make Community Work.

Make Creativity Work is a different story. Because it's so different from how our world operates today,  it could easily feel like pie-in-the-sky. But if we take a closer look at previous economic eras, we can see that while turning Make Creativity Work into a reality won't be easy, it's certainly doable.

There are three major objections Make Creativity Work needs to overcome:

<h4>1) Could most people actually obtain the skills and knowledge they would need to fully participate in Make Creativity Work?</h4>

<strong>We've Done It Before: Land-Grant Colleges, Agricultural Extension Services, Etc.</strong>. This isn't the first time we've had to try to figure out how to help millions of American workers take full advantage of the latest technology. From fostering a network of US Land-Grant Colleges in the late 19th-century to creating the Agriculture Extension Services in the early 20th century, the federal government has repeatedly created institutions to help farmers get and keep up to speed. Cooperative Extension Services, for example, ended up helping to fund staff to support this effort in virtually every county in the US.  This massive government intervention in agriculture helped radically drive agricultural productivity, in no small part because it encouraged the spread of mechanization and automation. There is no reason we couldn't do the same in an era where robotics, 3D printing, etc. are as central to the economy as agriculture was in previous economies.

The other thing that is striking about the US government's efforts in agriculture was they spent a lot of time thinking about not only how to develop new research in the fields of biology,, chemistry, soil science, etc. and show the results to farmers through demonstration projects but also how to design the output of this research so it was easy for farmers to use. Robotics and AI could do the same, building their programming tools and code so they are designed to make them as accessible as possible. Right now robot researchers are only trying to do that for kids; there's no reason we can't take a page from agriculture and make this tech much more accessible for adults too.

<strong>Hip-Hop Wasn't Created by Turntable Engineers</strong>
Hip Hop came out of neighborhoods that had lost 600,000 jobs lost to outsourcing and had been devastated by urban renewal.  The people who first created it lived in a community that had been stripped bare, and yet out of it this amazing music rose and then transformed not just music but  culture around the globe. A key part of Hip Hop's rise was technical -- converting turntables into musical instruments -- but this technical brilliance wasn't the result of the engineers who created turntables.

What the birth of hip-hop shows us is that to unlock the full potential of new technology, the most technically skilled people are only one small part of the story.   Even where technical skill is critical, some of the most important work won't be done by PhD's.  Grandmaster Flash, one of the "holy Trinity" who created hip-hop, had the most technical training of the three, and he'd just attended a vocational high school. But while Grandmaster Flash  wasn't a PhD scientist, he was a mad scientist -- a genius with an obsessive drive to experiment and create something new.  In short, as much as we want to spread the most technical of skills in every community, plenty of people who aren't the most technical will still play a core role in the world of Make Creativity Work.

<h4>2) But even if many people are able to participate in Make Creativity Work, will it ever pay enough so they could earn a good living?</h4>

Today, musicians and newspaper reporters are struggling to make ends meet while Google and other giants flourish. The reason: the rules that govern the Information Economy are designed to funnel wealth and power towards the top. That's one main reason why between 1980 and 2016, the bottom 90% saw no income growth.  But there was nothing natural or inevitable about that outcome. The Mass Consumer Economy shows that an economy can be governed by rules that distribute wealth very differently --  between 1930 and 1980, 70% of all income growth went to the bottom 90%.

Similarly, there's no inherent reason the economy has to be structured so it's winner-take-all. For example, the rules could be set up so that a creative product pays off at a progressively lower rate beyond 1 million views/uses. People who had a runaway hit would still do well, but there would be more resources in the system for a greater number of people who'd had smaller but substantial successes.

<h4>3) The people with power will never let us do it</h4>

It isn't a matter of the wealthy and big corporations "letting us" do it, it's a matter of us building the power needed to change the rules. In the 1930s and 40s, labor unions helped change the economy's rules so corporate profits didn't flow just to the top. The way they did it was by building grassroots power at the heart of the economy -- if GM wouldn't share the wealth autoworkers help to create, cars wouldn't keep rolling off the assembly line. There's no reason we can't follow their lead and build grassroots power at the heart of this new economy. For example, the reason the economy's rules are rigged against musicians today is that musicians are hopelessly outgunned If we use a community-oriented approach to Make Creativity Work, creating a network of people in every community who understand what's at stake and how changes in the rules will affect their ability to make a good living, there's no reason we can't turn the tide.

Moreover, elites are not a monolith. In the 1930s, you'd have been hard-pressed to find any corporate CEOs who were pro-union. By the 1950s, although there were still plenty of wealthy people who were rabidly antiunion, many corporate CEOs and senior staff took it for granted they would be sharing power with unions. Similarly, while some of today's 1% will always fight tooth and nail against the Makers All Economy, not all of them will. If we don't manage to solve the looming AI/robots crisis, the future looks pretty bleak even if you're a multimillion or billionaire -- especially since this new dystopian world would be filled with an awful lot of "peasants with pitchforks". Like movements in the past, there's no reason why we can't take advantage of splits between various elites.

Creating a Makers All Economy won't be a cakewalk. But with enough grassroots power, there is no reason to assume a movement couldn't succeed in creating an economy that is far more just than the one we have today.

<h2>A Final Note: Working Vs. Not Having to Work</h2>

What this argument doesn't directly address is a key question about our values: should we should fight for world where, given that more and more work no longer needs to be done by humans, no one has to work. I come down on the side that says that for the foreseeable future most people will still want to work if their work lives aren't filled with drudgery. I also freely admit that I could be completely wrong and that my thoughts on the subject are weighed down by centuries of our habits.

But my gut feeling is we won't know the answer to this question until we have some practical experience with Make Creativity Work. As I have learned the hard way as a manager of software development, it's extremely hard to know what you really want a new system to do until the rubber hits the road.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Can We Make Math More Acessible?</title>

				Why are 76% of all math PhDs awarded to men?  One major reason, <a href="http://motto.time.com/4717463/jo-boaler-women-stem-ivanka-trump-betsy-devos/">according</a> to Stanford math professor Jo Boaler, is the way math is taught.

<blockquote>At Stanford University, I teach some of the country’s highest achievers. But when they enter fast-paced lecture halls, even those  were successful in high school mathematics start to think they’re not good enough. One of my undergraduates described the panic she felt when trying to keep pace with a professor: “The material felt like it was flying over my head,” she wrote. “It was like I was watching a lecture at 2x or 3x speed and there was no way to pause or replay it.” She described her fear of failure as “crippling.” This student questioned her intelligence and started to rethink whether she belonged in the field of math at all.

Research tells us that lecturers typically speak at between 100 and 125 words a minute, but students can take note of only about 20 words a minute, often leaving them feeling frustrated and defeated.</blockquote>

This style of teaching doesn't work for lots of people -- one college math class was enough to turn me off from math.  But it hits women and people of color especially hard.

<blockquote>When students struggle in speed-driven math classes, they often believe the problem lies within themselves, not realizing that fast-paced lecturing is a faulty teaching method. The students most likely to internalize the problem are women and students of color.</blockquote>

But there's no reason math has to be taught the way it currently is.  Recently Boaler ran an interesting math teaching experiment that had impressive results.

<blockquote>In a recent summer camp with 81 middle school students, we taught mathematics through open, creative lessons to demonstrate how mathematics is about thinking deeply, rather than calculating quickly. After 18 lessons, the students improved their mathematics achievement on standardized tests by an average of 50%, the equivalent of 1.6 years of school.</blockquote>

What's true in math is even more true in robotics and AI:  if we want more people to use them, we need to take a hard look at how they're taught.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				A few days ago in a commencement address at Harvard, Mark Zuckerberg<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/26/news/economy/mark-zuckerberg-universal-basic-income/"> came out in favor of UBI</a>. &nbsp;In response, Forbes has a piece by Professor Robert Seamans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/washingtonbytes/2017/06/06/universal-basic-income-is-not-an-innovation-policy/#488405e72e8f">arguing</a> that UBI could actually hurt innovation. &nbsp;Seamans' first argument, that if UBI could be implemented by cutting other programs or policies that support innovation, is true but not that convincing; just because UBI could be poorly designed doesn't mean it will be. &nbsp;The second argument, however, is just bizarre:

<blockquote>If a UBI (or any other policy that shields borrowers from downside risk) increases the propensity for entrepreneurs to take risks because their downside is limited in the case of failure, this means that the capital provided by the financier is at greater risk. Thus, the financier may cut back on the amount of lending provided, or may continue to lend, but at a higher rate than before. Or, if the financier has trouble distinguishing between high- and low-quality risky projects, the financier may stop funding altogether.</blockquote>

One of the main barriers to getting started is keeping your head above water when you don't have any income you can count on.  If financiers knew that each team member of every potential investment had this eat-ramen-and-crash-with-someone level of safety net, this would make financiers less likely to invest? &nbsp;Or that'd they'd invest less because teams that failed would have a ramen-eating safety net to count on till they got a job? &nbsp;If that was the case, then middle class and upper middle class folks like Zuckerberg should have a harder time than working class or poor folks do getting start up financing, because they're more likely to have parents, credit cards, etc as a cushion. &nbsp;Anybody think that's the case?

What's Seamans' evidence for this strange claim?

<blockquote>The negative response to higher levels of borrower protection by financiers has been documented in a number of settings. For example, Michelle White, a professor at UC San Diego, and coauthors find that higher levels of bankruptcy exemptions (the amount of money that an individual can retain when declaring bankruptcy) are correlated with more loan denials and higher interest rates.... &nbsp;

A recent paper with my coauthors Geraldo Cerqueiro, Deepak Hegde and Fabiana Penas shows that higher levels of bankruptcy exemptions lead to less innovation—in terms of lower number of patents and lower overall patent quality—by small firms.</blockquote>

It looks to me like the results of&nbsp;<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2246982##">his study </a>are statistically signicant but aren't meaningful: &nbsp;the vast majority of small firms weren't filing many patents before or after the change in bankruptcy laws. &nbsp;But let's put that aside. &nbsp;

Bankruptcy exemptions are how much property/assets you can walk away with, aka resources your creditors don't get if you fail. &nbsp;They only matter if you have creditors, and a lot of the would-be entrepreneurs&nbsp;who will most benefit from UBI are likely to be people who either wouldn't or can't get small business loans. &nbsp;In fact, UBI might make getting a small business loan slightly easier because it means the business starts off with the equivalent of some cash to pay their employees. &nbsp;In any case, why would anyone assume financiers would treat having less initial pressure to generate employee pay as equivalent to small business owners&nbsp;being to walk away with more assets if their business fails?

As readers of this blog know, I have <a href="/2016/11/07/why-universal-basic-income-isnt-enough/">real problems with a UBI-only strategy </a>for tackling the threat of a robot/AI-based unemployment crisis. &nbsp;But Seamans' attacks on UBI as an innovation driver just don't cut it.		]]></content:encoded>

In the <a href="/2017/05/29/makers-all-framework-0-1/">latest version</a> of the Makers All framework, I argue that if you're skeptical about Make Creativity Work -- that many people in every community could gain the skills to earn part of their living creating robots, AI, etc -- the history of US agricultural extension services shows what's possible if we think big. I've been diving deeper into that history, and I've come across a remarkable woman named Mary Mims.

In 1925, Mims was <a href="http://www.lsuagcenter.com/portals/communications/publications/agmag/archive/2014/spring/the-extraordinary-mary-mims">hired</a> by Louisiana State University Agricultural Extension Division as the state’s first extension sociologist.  Through her amazing work in Louisiana, she ended up becoming an influential figure in the US.

<blockquote>
  Her book, The Awakening Community, which was published in 1932, launched her to national and international fame. The work, which features anecdotes, practical wisdom and concrete suggestions for building strong communities, became a model for community development for other states
  
  Mims was featured as a premier speaker at events in 48 states and was considered one of the greatest national orators of her day. She gave a speech alongside President Calvin Coolidge, travelled to personal conferences with national leaders and nobility in Europe and other parts of the world, and became one of the best known national advocates for community development.
</blockquote>

<a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/Bridging-Differences/2017/04/who_makes_change.html">According</a>  to scholar and organizer Harry C. Boyte, Mims' influence stemmed from the radical vision she advocated for and practiced.

<blockquote>
  Mary Mims developed the "community organizing method" in the cooperative extension service in the 1920s which spread to more than 1000 poor black and white communities across the south through the 1930s.
  
  Mims, like others in cooperative extension (home economics, 4-H and other areas) drew on the Jane Addams Hull House tradition. She was also inspired by folk schools in Denmark. These had a focus on agency, building the civic power of students, families, and larger communities. They were "schools for life," grounded in the experiences and life of common people not elites, with parallels to the "New School" (Escuela Nueva) movement in Latin America, begun in Columbia, which we've discussed before....
  
  In Mims view, professionals of any kind should be a  "leaven" for community self-organization. "So-called 'social workers' cannot hammer a community into shape," she argued in her book, The Awakening Community. "If a community grows, it must do so from the inside."
</blockquote>

And Mims wasn't alone.  Boyte <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/Bridging-Differences/2017/04/who_makes_change.html">notes</a> that

<blockquote>
  In the US, the United States Department of Agriculture and land grant colleges from 1937 to 1942 involved more than three million people in rural America in community discussions about the future of rural life, taking up issues that ranged from commodity prices and soil erosion to the future of democracy in America
</blockquote>

When I think of government ag support, this isn't remotely the image that pops into my mind.  Extension services may end up being a much more rich vein to mine than I expected.		]]></content:encoded>

I've been learning about Fab Labs, and it's blowing my mind.

If you've ever heard about Fab Labs, you probably have a vague sense that they're about making a bunch of cool tools like 3D printing more accessible. It's possible you also remember that the folks who are involved in Fab Labs think eventually we'll have Star Trek-like replicators. In other words, neat stuff if you're a geek, but that's about it. The real story is a lot more interesting.

Fab Labs came out of MIT's <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/about/index.html">Center for Bits and Atoms</a> (CBA). CBA has a far-out mission: to figure out "how to turn data into things, and things into data." The National Science Foundation has given CBA millions of dollars to pay for tools and research, and at one point they wanted to be able to briefly show off what this money was producing. So, CBA whipped up a demonstration project they called a Fab Lab: a room full of equipment costing a lot less than millions of dollars that an ordinary mortal could learn how to use and build something interesting. It unexpectedly took off, and now there are around 1,000 Fab Labs  across the globe.

According to the Fab Lab <a href="http://www.fabfoundation.org/index.php/about-fab-foundation/index.html">FAQ</a>, today a Fab Lab consists of the following equipment:

<blockquote>
  •A computer-controlled lasercutter, for press-fit assembly of 3D structures from 2D parts
  •A larger (4'x8') numerically-controlled milling machine, for making furniture- (and house-) sized parts
  •A signcutter, to produce printing masks, flexible circuits, and antennas
  •A precision (micron resolution) milling machine to make three-dimensional molds and surface-mount circuit boards
  •Programming tools for low-cost high-speed embedded processors
  
  These work with components and materials optimized for use in the field, and are controlled with custom software for integrated design, manufacturing, and project management.
</blockquote>

The total cost for all of this equipment: around $50,000 plus materials.

Interestingly, 3D printers, which get a lot of attention in the media, aren't a big part of Fab Labs. CBA's director Neil Gershenfeld <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/digital-fabrication">says</a> 3D printers are the microwave ovens of the fabrication world.

<blockquote>
  "The coverage of 3D printing is a bit like the coverage of microwave ovens in the 50s. Microwaves are useful for some things, but they didn't replace the rest of your kitchen," he said, speaking at the Royal Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenges summit. "The kitchen is more than a microwave oven.
</blockquote>

The room full of tools that make up a Fab Lab are pretty cool, but the tools are just the tip of the iceberg. First, according to the Fab Lab FAQ:

<blockquote>
  Fab labs share core capabilities, so that people and projects can be shared across them.
</blockquote>

In other words, Fab Labs aren't a loose coalition of maker spaces; they are explicitly designed as a network of labs that can build off one another. For example, if a person in one lab comes up with a design, someone in another web should be able to reuse it. Given that the number of Fab Labs has been doubling almost every two years, the potential of this network is impressive.

Second, Fab Labs have a vision of how they will make this technology more accessible. Anyone can go to a Fab Labs and get help in how to to use this new technology. Many Fab Labs also participate in a formal training program called <a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fab Academy</a>: a five-month course currently offered by 100 Fab Labs around the globe where you can earn a certificate. Unlike <a href="https://www.mooc-list.com/">MOOCs</a>, Fab Academy <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2016/3-questions-neil-gershenfeld-fab-labs-0104">combines</a> the best of face-to-face and distributed online learning:

<blockquote>
  Students with peers are organized in workgroups in Fab Labs, with local instructors and tools, which are then linked globally through interactive video lectures and collaborative project management
</blockquote>

The last interesting tidbit from the FAQ is that

<blockquote>
  [The Fab Lab's] inventory is continuously evolving, towards the goal of a fab lab being able to make a fab lab.
</blockquote>

And that's what makes the world of Fab Labs so different from 90% of what's out there. Plenty of people have interesting ideas about what the future will look like. Fab Labs are different: they are part of a well-thought-out strategy for incrementally, iteratively building towards a radically different future.

In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNhXjXYLLvc">2017 talk</a>, Gershenfeld compares their work to the history of computers. CBA's core research facilities are like the old mainframes: a massive amount of machines that cost a ton of money and that were accessible to only a handful of people.

Fab Labs are the equivalent of the 1970's minicomputers. Minicomputers only took up the space of a few refrigerators, and because they were much cheaper than mainframes, they put a considerable amount of power in the hands of more people.

But a minicomputer is like a horse and buggy compared to today's smart phones and iPads. And just like computers moved from minicomputers to hobbyist computers to personal computers, he thinks they will be able to do the same with digital fabricators. Currently, their research roadmap says that in 20 years they will have built out the technology for personal-sized digital fabricators.

One of the main destinations on this roadmap is moving beyond 3D printers that spray materials and laser cutters that slice materials to materials that can assemble and dissemble themselves. As a Wired magazine article <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/digital-fabrication">described</a> it,

<blockquote>
  For Gershenfeld, the real revolution of fabrication is much more fundamental: it's bringing programmability to the physical world. He invited the audience to compare the performance of a child assembling Lego and a 3D printer. The child's assembly of Lego will be more accurate than the child's motor skills would allow -- that's because the pieces are designed to snap together in alignment. Meanwhile, the 3D printing process accumulates errors, perhaps due to imperfect adhesion in the bottom layers. Lego is also available in different materials, while 3D printers have limited ability to use dissimilar materials. Finally, a Lego construction can be easily disassembled.
</blockquote>

Currently, they are exploring this radical new approach in a joint project with NASA on <a href="http://newatlas.com/mit-nasa-digital-materials-morphing-wings/46262/">building aircraft</a>.

<blockquote>
  The NASA/MIT approach is... to fundamentally redesign the structure of the wing so it is capable of bending by itself. The design achieves this by dividing the wing into lightweight, overlapping scale- or feather-like sub-segments. These are supported by tunable and actively deformable modular building blocks, dubbed "digital materials," that are made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers that can be quickly engineered and snapped together and allow the wing to deform while maintaining a smooth, aerodynamic surface.... So far, wind tunnel tests have shown the test wing has aerodynamic properties of a conventional wing weighing 10 times more.
</blockquote>

In short, Fab Labs aren't just about putting some maker tools in the hands of folks today.  They are part of a larger, bolder vision plus the infrastructure to make it happen.  As the <a href="http://www.fabfoundation.org">Fab Foundation</a> <a href="http://www.fabfoundation.org/index.php/about-fab-foundation/index.html">explains</a>,

<blockquote>
  This community is simultaneously a manufacturing network, a distributed technical education campus, and a distributed research laboratory working to digitize fabrication, inventing the next generation of manufacturing and personal fabrication.
</blockquote>

Fab Labs and the broader project they are part of have some striking implications for the <a href="/ma-framework/">Makers All framework</a>. &nbsp;CBA's research roadmap estimates that they will have developed the tech for personal replicators in 20 years -- in other words, around the time the robots/AI-driven jobs crisis is likely to hit. Even if CBA's estimate is too optimistic, the tech plus the network of labs, people, and training they will have developed by 2040 will be a game changer, and it'll greatly expand what Make Creativity Work could do.

There's a lot more to say here. For example, the educational infrastructure that the Fab Labs Network is building out should allay some concerns about Make Creativity Work's argument that lots of people from every community could eventually participate in creating robots/AI.   But honestly, I'm still wrapping my head around what CBA's work could mean for Makers All.

But as exciting as this work is, there's a project to take it to a whole new level. Up Next: Fab Cities		]]></content:encoded>

				In my <a href="/2017/07/04/fab-labs-and-the-future-of-makers-all/">last post</a>, I discussed the amazing work that's being done in Fab Labs. There's another part of the story: <a href="http://fab.city">Fab City</a>. Fab City, which was launched in 2011, is a joint project of the <a href="https://iaac.net/">Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia</a>, the Barcelona City Council, the MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA), and the Fab Foundation. Its <a href="http://fab.city/whitepaper.pdf">goal</a> is ambitious:

<blockquote>
  Fab City takes the ideals of the Fab Lab - the connectivity, culture and creativity - and scales it to the City. It is a new urban model of transforming and shaping cities
</blockquote>

One of the core ideas is to move

<blockquote>
  from ‘Products In Trash Out’ (PITO) to ‘Data In Data Out’ (DIDO). This means that more production occurs inside the city, along with recycling materials and meeting local needs through local inventiveness. A city’s imports and exports would mostly be found in the form of data (information, knowledge, design, code).
</blockquote>

The Fab City project has an ambitious <a href="http://fab.city/#fabcity">roadmap</a>. By 2054, cities that sign on to the project will attempt to achieve the following:

<blockquote>
  Cities produce at least 50% of what they consume
  
  A global repository of open source designs for city solutions
  
  Materials are source locally through recycling and digital materials
</blockquote>

Although much of Fab City is focused around the world of fabrication, to reach a goal of cities producing at least 50% of what they consume, cities would also focus on growing food.

<blockquote>
  Urban farming will scale up from experimental practice to large scale infrastructure. Local production of foods at domestic, neighbourhood and city scales will create a closed loop system for food production and harvesting."
</blockquote>

How will Fab Cities pull this off? At this point, it's really unclear -- and as a Fab City <a href="https://blog.fab.city/fab-city-building-sustainable-cities-through-local-production-making-and-collaborative-platforms-493fc11dbfe2">blog post</a> points out, that's understandable given how early they are in the process.

<blockquote>
  Tomas [Diez, one of the movement's originators] avoids trying to predict exactly what our cities will look like in 2054 (we all know how wildly wrong technological prophets have been in the past), and explains that there is no fully formed vision of what a Fab City will look like. Instead, he describes Fab Cities as an emerging process of experimentation.  "We are flying an aeroplane while we are building it."
</blockquote>

One of these experiments is taking place in Barcelona,

<blockquote>
  [in]&nbsp;the newly designated makers’ district in Barcelona’s Poblenou neighbourhood. Working in partnership with the council, Fab City enthusiasts hope to create a Fab City Prototype in Poblenou as the area becomes an experimentation playground for trialing new systems of production and interaction....  The prototype sees residents experimenting in three main areas: material production, food production, and energy production. On the most fundamental level, this means manufacturing goods in makerspaces, growing food on rooftops, and storing energy collected via solar panels in domestic batteries. However, if enough citizens become empowered as producers rather than simply consumers, a whole new range of relations and transactions are possible.
</blockquote>

I also can't figure out what the Fab City movement thinks our economy should look like by 2054. Again, not too surprising considering how new the project is -- and how mind-blowing some of the tech is. In one of CBA Director Neil Gershenfeld's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNhXjXYLLvc">talks</a>, he argues that in the future, perhaps instead of having to get a job doing work we don't want to do to earn money to buy a product, for some of our needs we could just  fabricate the product ourselves. Understanding the economic implications of that is no small feat. Hopefully, Makers All could be helpful in fleshing that out.

In the next few months I'm going to reach out to some of the folks involved in Fab Labs and Fab Cities; their work will definitely have a big impact on Makers All. Stay tuned...		]]></content:encoded>

Roomba inventor Joe Jones has a new company and a new product he's trying to fund through Kickstarter:  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rorymackean/tertill-the-solar-powered-weeding-robot-for-home-g">Tertill</a>, "a solar-powered and weatherproof robot that weeds your garden every day."  In an <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/roomba-inventor-joe-jones-on-weed-killing-robot.amp.html#qaTopicFive">interview</a> about Terrill, Jones has a great quote about what robots can and can't easily do today:

<blockquote>
  Robots are deceptively hard. My co-founder at Harvest, Clara Vu, likes to say, “A robot application that a technology grad student thinks they can easily do in a couple of weeks has an outside chance of actually being practical. Anything harder is impossible.”
</blockquote>

That's why assuming that the real threat to jobs won't arrive until around 2040 makes sense to me; bots and AI are improving at a pretty brisk clip, but they've still got a ways to go.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Principle #1: Pick Solutions That Pay off Even if The Crisis Doesn&#039;t Occur by 2040</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Today, two sharp policy writers took a whack at each other over the robots/AI-will-destroy-jobs debate. Dylan Matthews confidently <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/17/15364546/universal-basic-income-review-stern-murray-automation">wrote</a> that there's no reason to think that when it comes automation, this time it'll be different. Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/07/mass-unemployment-will-start-around-2025/">wrote</a> with equal confidence, "mass unemployment will start about 2025."

Here's the dirty little secret: no one has a freaking clue.

That's why one of the core principles of Makers All is that our strategy should pay off regardless of whether we get hit by a mass unemployment crisis by 2040. That way, there's a lot less at stake about whose prediction is right.

This principle is one reason why Makers All focuses so heavily on Make Creativity Work. Regardless of where people come down on the threat robots/AI pose to good paying jobs, everyone agrees that robots and AI are going to become ubiquitous in our economy. So either way, there's not much downside to making sure that in every community as many people as possible can participate in creating robots and AI.

Obviously, this approach won't work for every solution. But as a general rule, I think it makes a lot more sense to spend less time arguing about whether we will end up with a massive unemployment crisis and spend more time coming up with solutions that can help build a more prosperous, more just economy either way.		]]></content:encoded>

This summer, unmanned convenience stores are taking off in Beijing and Shanghai.  BingoBox, Eat Box, and others are launching stores where you grab, pay, and go without ever talking to a clerk.&nbsp;

&nbsp;To keep you from just grabbing and going, these stores have a double door-based security system where you to use either a QR code or facial recognition tied to an account to get into the store. &nbsp;When you try to leave, you can't get through the second door if the RFID tag on your soda doesn't tell the security system that you've paid.

Nor surpassingly, the launches haven't gone off without a hitch.   BingoBox stores discovered the hard way that if you don't have good air conditioning, the summer turns their store into a HeatBox, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/china-bingo-box-convenience-store-shanghai-melting-heat-2017-7">melting chocolates and little  cakes</a>.  But overall, their prospects look very promising.

I couldn't find estimates on how much these unmanned stores will reduce labor costs; even if there's no clerk, someone still needs to restock, keep the place clean, etc, and from what I could read it's not clear how the stores are getting that work done.  And of all the jobs that may get eliminated, I don't think many people are going to shed too many tears over the loss of these jobs given how poorly they pay and how crappy these jobs are.  But as one more sign of where we might be headed -- especially given that the tech involved in eliminating these jobs is pretty primitive -- it doesn't &nbsp;paint an optimistic picture.

For more details, check out this walk though of an Eat Box:

Cutting edge tech usually takes a while before it reaches low-income or marginalized communities. Hard-working community groups often struggle to train a handful of people to use this new tech so that a trickle of the billions of dollars generated by this tech reaches their community.

But what if instead of being relegated to the back of the bus, these communities grabbed a seat at the front?

To understand what that might look like, here's a thought experiment using the cutting-edge field of augmented reality (AR).

If virtual reality is about creating objects in an imaginary world, augmented reality is about placing imaginary objects in the real world. Last year's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/07/26/monster-game/#536edf3356a6">Pokémon Go craze</a> was an amazing albeit goofy example of one way augmented reality can work: looking at the world through your smart phone, you can play Pokémon in the real life. In the next few years, augmented reality is going to take off like a rocket, and there are billions of dollars of profit at stake.

Next month when iOS 11 is rolled out, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/arkit/">ARKit</a>, Apple's opening salvo in the battle over these profits, will turn newer iPhones into <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/arkit-augmented-reality/">a tool for general purpose augmented reality</a>:

<blockquote>
  ARKit lets developers build AR apps, which integrate digital experiences into the physical world via iPhone or iPad, a la Pokémon Go. Those apps will be available to consumers when iOS 11 arrives in September. But developers have started tinkering—creating tools that let you see how furniture fits in a room or quickly calculate the area of your kitchen.... Matthew Miesnieks, a VC who led a team researching AR within Samsung, calls ARKit “the biggest thing that’s happened to the AR industry since it began,” and he’s not alone in his enthusiasm. By getting AR in the hands of millions of iPhone users, Apple is poised to become the world’s most powerful and popular purveyor of augmented-reality apps. And by opening up its developers’ kit, it’s powering hundreds of experiments into what, precisely, this medium is good for.
</blockquote>

Already we've seen examples of using ARKit as everything from using it as a <a href="https://mobile-ar.reality.news/news/apple-ar-use-augmented-reality-measure-rooms-without-tape-measure-0178760/">measuring tape</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/6/9/15771772/ios-11-arkit-augmented-reality-examples-fidget-spinner">populating your room with dogs and space cats</a> to a really cool <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/7/26/16035376/arkit-augmented-reality-a-ha-take-on-me-video-trixi-studios">interactive music video</a>. Industry analysts also speculate that iPhone-based AR is just Apple's first step and that they are developing headsets which will provide a more immersive experience.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is so confident about their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens">Hololens</a>, the augmented and virtual reality glasses they started rolling out to select partners last year, that it's going to skip releasing version 2.0 this year and instead is going release a souped-up, AI-infused v3.0 to the public in 2019. Hololens is already being used in the real world. Thyssenkrupp already has 100 elevator and stair lift technicians testing it out in the field as an AR-driven <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/with-hololens-microsoft-plots-a-prosaic-path-toward-success/">tech-manual-plus-Skype tool for elevator repair</a>. Case Western is experimenting with using Hololens for creating <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2017/08/cwru_and_boulevard_announce_re.html">museum walk-throughs</a>. And when Case Western and the Cleveland Clinic open a new health education campus in 2019, students will learn anatomy using a <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/hololens-md-why-this-medical-school-will-teach-doctors-anatomy-with-microsofts-augmented-reality-not/">Hololens AR cadaver</a>.

Because of what's known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>, battles over emerging tech are almost always <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/in-silicon-valley-now-its-almost-always-winner-takes-all">winners-take-all</a>. So the titans of the tech world are now in a fierce battle to see which 2 or 3 players will dominate this multi-billion-dollar industry for years to come. As a result, there is a unique opportunity for community groups to influence the outcome -- if they work together.

What if groups in communities from Compton to Letcher County, Kentucky to the suburban Rust Belt of Ohio created a network to ensure that as this new tech started taking off, their voices were heard and their communities were involved in the work shaping the course of this new tech and its economic impact?

To make that happen, they could leverage a problem most tech players have. One of the main lessons of my decades of experience in both the corporate and community world is that access isn't just an issue for marginalized communities; corporations and large nonprofits also struggle with it. Corporations can often paper over the problem by throwing money at it, spending scary amounts of money on consultants and/or hiring just enough techies to do work that regular staff ought to be able to handle if the tech wasn't so hard to use. But if this network of communities can experiment with the new tech, they should be able to show the major players how to change the tech so it's also far more accessible in the corporate world. If it's much easier for people in South Central or Harlan County to use new tech without being uber-geeks, it'll certainly be a lot more accessible to corporate "power users"-- people who aren't trained programmers but who can, say, make Excel sit up &amp; dance and who often play a critical role in the diffusion of new tech through a large organization. And that's a huge competitive advantage for any tech players striving to dominate this new tech.

To make this emerging tech more accessible, the community network would need to focus on two tasks:

<ul>
<li>Making the existing tools for this new tech more accessible by creating better trainings and, even more importantly, creating an ecosystem around these tools that provides longer term support. A one-time training is a good place to start, but to gain fluency people need the ability to easily get help as they continue to use the tech.</li>
<li>Doing simple experiments to figure out how the tools could be remade to smooth the learning curve. With most new tech, it's really easy to do a handful of tasks, but as soon you want to go beyond the basics you fall off a cliff. Even corporate power users will often end up wasting an absurd number of hours banging their head against the wall to get this tech to work. Depending on how this new tech is designed -- e.g., if it uses an "open source" approach where people can modify the code themselves -- it may even be possible to use these experiments to either make the tools easier to use or to build a layer on top that hides some of the more confusing aspects.</li>
</ul>

But how could these small community groups, who are already severely strapped for resources, have the time and energy to make this happen without being diverted from the important work they're already doing? By a second act of leveraging: collaborating with techies outside of their groups.

Odds are, for example, there are students in colleges near some of these community groups who would love to help but don't know how. Similarly, there web designers who would love to learn how to work with augmented reality, which is going to dramatically change their world, and are also passionate about helping the community. There are programmers who'd love to play around with coding augmented reality, both for professional development but also because it's their idea of fun. The network of communities would give these techies an easy way to have an impact on the world that would be deeply satisfying.

The same thing is also true for experts in the field. One of the cool things about the tech world is that many of the most skilled people in it are remarkably generous with their time. They love the tech and want everyone to be able to enjoy it. Again, the hardest problem many of them have is that they simply don't know where to begin. They strongly believe in "democratizing" the tech but lack the skills to take this complex knowledge and break it down for everyday folks. But in most communities that would be part of the network, there are people who may not be techies but who are experts in breaking down complex concepts so they make sense to folks in their community.

Best of all, many of the techies who would love to help are themselves part of existing local &amp; national networks that the network of marginalized communities could tap into.

In short, this network of communities could use a "stone soup"-style organizing approach, helping bring together far more resources than they normally could. And that in turn should make it pretty straightforward to get tech players to want to work with them.

But how could groups who are part of this network afford to get their hands on this new tech? If communities are working together, I think that's a problem that's pretty straightforward to solve. When the tech is very early, the tiny startups who are driving it forward don't have the money to donate equipment or sell it dirt cheap. But when the tech hits the stage where tech titans are battling over who will dominate it, these players certainly do. In fact, if they think of it as early market penetration plus great PR, seeding this equipment in these marginalized communities is really just a form of cheap advertising -- and these are folks that are going to end up spending an awful lot of money on advertising given the profits that are ultimately at stake.

To people who haven't had the experience of being involved in emerging tech, this may seem crazily ambitious. But one of the most important lessons of the last decade with new tech is that small groups can have a remarkable impact if instead of trying to build perfect palaces, they iterate using lots of small experiments. The key is to take a low-risk approach: start with a handful of people trying out the new tech, explore &amp; map out opportunities, and then take baby steps. The hard part here isn't the tech, it's the people: getting a network of community groups to strategically act together in a new domain is not a trivial task.

In almost every community that our society has abandoned, you'll find amazing people doing what they can to help their communities get back on their feet. Up till now, it's been a battle fought on terrain where it's incredibly hard to win. Maybe it's time to try some experiments fighting on the terrain of emerging tech.

Up Next: a similar strategy for <a href="/2017/08/30/on-ai-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">artificial intelligence</a>, and <a href="/2017/08/24/why-augmented-realty-instead-of-robots/">why focus today on augmented reality rather than robots</a>

<hr />

UPDATE:  two weeks after I wrote this post, Google announced <a href="/2017/08/31/google-steps-up-its-ar-game/">their next big step in AR</a>.  Their earlier work was very interesting but aimed at a relatively small set of devices; their newest entry is going for a wider audience, and  it's very impressive.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				One point missing from <a href="/2017/08/18/on-augmented-reality-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">last week's post</a> on how a network of community groups could influence the direction of Augmented Reality (AR): why start with AR? Why not start with robots?

The answer is simple: robots aren't ready for ordinary folks to do real work. The tech is still too primitive; it's too difficult to do anything useful with robots unless you're a pro. Here's Roomba inventor Joe Jones on <a href="/2017/07/12/robot-tech-still-has-a-long-way-to-go/">how far robots have to go</a>:

<blockquote>
  Robots are deceptively hard. My co-founder at Harvest, Clara Vu, likes to say, “A robot application that a technology grad student thinks they can easily do in a couple of weeks has an outside chance of actually being practical. Anything harder is impossible.”
</blockquote>

In contrast, AR is good to go. In the next few years it'll get easier to do development in AR, but even today there's plenty of room for community based efforts to do interesting work in AR.

In doing so, this network of community groups would lay the technical groundwork needed for the coming robot revolution. Augmented reality and robots don't use exactly the same tech. But if you know how to do advanced AR coding, picking up how to program robots shouldn't be too big of a stretch -- especially since a lot of the programming languages for machine learning/AI that will eventually play a critical role with robots can be picked up today.

Similarly, once this network's trainers have figured out the techniques, processes, metaphors, etc. to make the coding concepts behind AR much more accessible, they've got a blueprint for doing so with robots much more quickly. Having already proven out these techniques with AR, it'll be much easier to convince the designers of robot software to incorporate some of the techniques from the get-go.

More importantly, the work around AR will help build the networks of relationships and trust within and across communities. As anyone who's been involved in multi-community organizing can tell you, building this kind of social infrastructure takes a lot of blood, sweat, tears, and time (not to mention repeatedly banging your head against the wall). But once those relationships and trust have been built, they can easily be reused when the robot tech is ready.

As a result, by the time robots had developed to the point where, for example, it was clear that in a year or two we would start to see robot app stores, there should be more than enough of the community infrastructure these groups would need to successfully win a seat at the table.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>App Stores, Streaming Music, and Community Voice:  A Thought Experiment</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/app-stores-streaming-music-and-community-voice-a-thought-experiment/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				My <a href="/2017/08/18/on-augmented-reality-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">post</a> on community groups and augmented reality (AR) covered a lot of ground. Today I'm going spend a little more time on one point: what could this sort of organizing accomplish?

So, a thought experiment:

Imagine that if before Apple created its iPhone apps store, instead of making decisions unilaterally, it was in dialogue with communities from Compton to Letcher County, Kentucky to the suburban Rust Belt of Ohio -- people who by the Internet Age our society had effectively written off. And imagine that people from these communities had a voice not only because they could vote or organize economic pressure but because in each of these communities many people were fluent with the tech behind iPhones.

Now imagine that if before Spotify, YouTube, and other players "disrupted" the music industry, transforming an already unjust, racist system so that now most musicians can't earn a living by selling/streaming their records, these same communities had a real say in shaping the new rules of the road and who benefited from them.

Now take that impact and multiply it by 100. Sometime in the next 10 to 20 years we are going to reach a point where similar decisions are being made about how robots/AI will dramatically reshape our economy. Only this time the stakes will be much higher: a staggering amount of wealth will be created, and it's possible that an unimaginable number of jobs may be destroyed.

That's why it's worth figuring out how all communities can have a seat at the table where the rules of this new road are made.

In turn, that's why it's critical that in each of these communities there are enough people who are working with this new tech and can explain them to the rest of their community. A seat at the table is meaningless if you don't understand the nuances of this new tech well enough to understand a rule's implications. And often the table where community groups need a seat won't be in Congress, it'll be at meeting of coders.

<hr />

NOTE: Just in case it wasn't clear, the Apple and Spotify/YouTube examples really are just thought experiments. For example, in the real world it wouldn't be fair to expect that Apple would've shared enough of their iPhone plans with the public in advance so that communities could have had a real say. What I've learned from talking with people about Makers All is that it's hard for most folks to imagine what an economy might look like when robots/AI are ubiquitous; these thought experiments are a small step in helping folks wrap their head around it.		]]></content:encoded>

				On "Deep Learning" AI and Not Sitting At the Back of the Bus

In my post on the emerging tech of <a href="/2017/08/18/on-augmented-reality-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">augmented reality (AR)</a>, I argued that the AR offers community groups --  especially those in communities that our society has written off -- a unique opportunity to change the course of emerging tech so that more the benefits flow to their communities. I think the same is true for AI.

As I mentioned in an <a href="/2017/08/24/why-augmented-realty-instead-of-robots/">earlier post</a>, robots aren't ready for ordinary folks to do real work:  the tech is still too primitive.  But a lot of robotics will be driven by technology where the baby version of it is available now. Most notably, although AI is ridiculously underpowered compared to where it'll be in 20+ years, you can actually do something useful with it today -- and the field is really taking off.  Forrester predicted that investment in AI would grow by 30% this year. Gartner <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3763265">predicts</a> that "by 2020, AI technologies will be virtually pervasive in almost every new software product and service," and IDC <a href="http://www.ciodive.com/news/ai-revenues-to-see-explosive-growth-through-2020-idc-forecasts/429140/">estimates</a> that by 2020 revenue from AI-based systems will hit $47 billion. There is also an almost insatiable demand for people who are fluent with current AI tech.

As a result, Google, Microsoft, and others are in a race to see who can make their AI programming libraries and tools more accessible. Today, a typical programmer could learn how to write a 15-line program that will, say, recognize pictures of a cat or answer a moderately impressive range of questions that only advanced practitioners could accomplish a decade ago (see more at the end of this post). Becoming really skilled at this tech still takes a lot of work, but the barriers to entry are far lower than they used to be.

There's also been a flurry of work online to make it easier to learn these AI tools. For example,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval</a> has created a charming, funny YouTube series aimed at hackers who want to do cool stuff with AI; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw">Josh Gordon</a> at Google and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BrandonRohrer">Brandon Rohrer</a> at Microsoft (Microsoft: whole course) have also produced really helpful YouTube tutorials. And there are first-rate free courses at <a href="http://www.fast.ai/">Fast AI</a> that make it much easier for someone with some programming background to do some really impressive work.

Almost all the major players in this space they want to "democratize" this technology. Recently, for example, Google launched the People and AI Research Initiative <a href="https://www.blog.google/topics/machine-learning/pair-people-ai-research-initiative/">PAIR</a>), whose goal is

<blockquote>
  "to focus on the "human side" of AI: the relationship between users and technology, the new applications it enables, and how to make it broadly inclusive."
</blockquote>

Based on what they've done so far, I think the major tech players are very sincere in wanting to make AI more accessible.

But when these players use the word "democratize," what their work shows they really mean is making it fully accessible to people like me, who are programmers.  There are more and more types of analysis that you can do using AI by pushing a few buttons. But once you go beyond basic work, there's a pretty big gap between what most tech players they want to do and what they are doing.

That's why I think a network of community groups could have a real impact on AI. And unlike just a few years ago, there are a lot more opportunities for some interesting partnerships.
For example, fast.ai's terrific courses <a href="http://course.fast.ai/start.html">say</a> they are aimed at "anyone with at least one year's coding experience." If any network of community groups wanted to work with fast.ai to create courses and a community-oriented ecosystem for learning that would make this knowledge accessible to even more people, I'm sure the people at fast.ai would be excited by the idea.

Playing with AI today isn't as fun as playing with augmented reality. But there are some incredible opportunities here to help shape the direction of the tech industry and who will benefit from this emerging tech.

NOTE: If you are one of the readers of this blog who likes geeking out with tech and want to get your feet wet with AI, I'd recommend playing with  <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>. Keras is an open source library developed by a someone at Google which makes coding "deep learning" AI much easier. Through Keras, you can work with a variety of AI libraries, including Google's <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> and Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk">CNTK</a>, using the same code. The other fabulous thing about Keras is that it bakes in a lot of best practices. When I first tried to start learning machine learning and AI a few years ago, figuring out how to write the code wasn't that hard. But to properly use the code, you needed to make decisions about a bewildering number of options, and trying to figure out what those options meant was very painful. Keras sets a lot of those options for you, see you don't have to worry about tweaking them until you really know what you're doing.

If you do decide you want to play, I would strongly recommend starting with <a href="http://www.fast.ai/">Fast AI</a>'s <a href="http://course.fast.ai/index.html">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a>. It's a very impressive piece of work. And in the <a href="http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lesson1.html">first hands-on lesson</a>, you learn how to do some really cool stuff in just a handful of lines of code.		]]></content:encoded>

				Google steps up its AR game with <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-vr/arcore-augmented-reality-android-scale/">ARCore</a>:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ggExOm7BkA8

A fabulous, whimsical ARCore experiment by <a href="http://janefriedhoff.com">Jane Feidhoff</a>  (more info <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/JaneFriedhoff/20170830/304749/Making_Portal_Painter_inARCore.php">here</a>).

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TckqNdrdbgk
<a href="https://www.tiltbrush.com">Tilt Brush</a> was built for VR, but apparently it will work with Google's new ARCore universe.

To help refine Tilt Brush, Google set up an Artist in Residence program that eventually involved a total of 60 artists from a wide variety of styles:

At some point I'll do an analysis of Google's new venture into AR.  For now I just wanted to post these videos, because they're so freakin cool.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Silicon Valley Elites: 2 Parts Liberal to 1 Part Libertarian?</title>

				David Broockman, Neil Malhotra, and Greg Ferenstein have published an interesting study of the political views of the US tech elite.  Silicon Valley types are usually thought of as Libertarians -- or more accurately, Lockheed Libertarians who're against all government except for the programs that ice their cake.  Turns out it's a more complicated picture.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/silicon-valley-politics.html">According</a> to the New York Times,

<blockquote>
  On most culture-war issues, they are unrepentantly liberal. They oppose restrictions on abortion, favor gay rights, support gun control and oppose the death penalty.
</blockquote>

They also support raising their own taxes to fund health care and protect the environment.

<blockquote>
  Now for the twist. The study found one area where tech entrepreneurs strongly deviate from Democratic orthodoxy and are closer to most Republicans: They are deeply suspicious of the government’s efforts to regulate business, especially when it comes to labor. They said that it was too difficult for companies to fire people, and that the government should make it easier to do so. They also hope to see the influence of both private and public-sector unions decline.
</blockquote>

To try to get a better sense of how these elites feel about regulation, researchers asked whether it was ok for a business like a florist to use surge pricing.  Both traditional Democratic and Republican donors think it's unfair, but 96% of the tech elites were good with it.

<blockquote>
  “My guess is there’s an underlying principle to their views,” Dr. Broockman said. “They see an entrepreneur trying to do what they want in the marketplace, and they see nothing unfair about that.”
</blockquote>

It'd be interesting to see how tech elites' political attitudes today compare to how they felt, say, 20 years ago.  I'm guessing that the rise of inequality, the rise of resentment against tech startups in San Francisco  -- eg., the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/12/17/251960183/in-a-divided-san-francisco-private-tech-buses-drive-tension">dust ups over Google buses</a> that started back in 2013 -- and increasing fears about automation have pushed them away from Lockheed Libertarianism to a political position that's a lot more muddled.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Meanwhile, Back in Barcelona... Creating Smart Cities from the Bottom Up</title>

If Silicon Valley elites have become <a href="/2017/09/07/silicon-valley-elites-2-parts-liberal-to-1-part-libertarian/">2 parts liberal to 1 part libertarian</a>, Barcelona techies have become 1 part wild-eyed radicals to 2 parts Get-R-Done.  If you're feeling a little depressed about the world, do yourself a favor and watch this amazing talk by Barcelona's CTO, Francesca Bria on "Barcelona’s Strategy for Digital Sovereignty."  The scope of what they've been working on is breaktaking, and what they've managed to accomplish so far is pretty damn impressive.  What I particularly appreciated was the effort to blend really bold ideas and smart, practical on-the-ground ideas.  It's not that often you hear someone talk about emancipatory democratic visions, movement building, and strategeies for procurement reform in the same breath -- one good sign that this is the real deal.

What's particularly exciting about this work happening right now is that it's taking place in an environment where cities across the globe are beginning to learn from each other and collaborate much more than they had in the past.  In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ntnnThTz4">another talk</a> at the same conference, Mark Watts, Executive Director for <a href="http://www.c40.org/">C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group</a>, walked through a variety of examples of how innovations developed by a few cities have gotten implemented by other cities at a remarkable speed (ironically, spurred on in part by Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Change Accords).  So as Barcelona and their collaborators continue to break new ground, these ideas might actually come to a city near you.		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Watching CTO Francesca Bria's <a href="/2017/09/08/meanwhile-back-in-barcelona-creating-smart-cities-from-the-bottom-up/">amazing talk</a> on Barcelona's bottom up tech efforts, I realized why I haven't gotten to writing about how the markets proposed by Make Creativity Work might function.

There are a number of groups across the globe who are trying interesting experiments in what's sometimes called <a href="https://platform.coop/">Platform Cooperatives</a> that are trying to build an alternative to an economy dominated by Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. I have complicated feelings about these efforts.

The way think about it is similar to what I think around healthcare. I'm strongly in favor of Single-Payer, Medicare/Medicaid for All, or national health insurance. But almost every industrialized country other than us has a healthcare system that works quite well for their citizens, and most of them don't use one of those approaches. My goal is to get the job done even if the end result isn't exactly what I want.

So although I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Platform Cooperative's crowd, given just how bad things could get if we don't get a solution to the robot jobs crisis threat in time, I wouldn't want to say there's only one right solution. And if I'm being completely honest with myself, more than a handful of people who talk about co-ops in general and platform co-ops in particular are so loosey-goosey about how the tiny examples they love to talk &amp; talk &amp; talk about would scale to the point where they would have a real effect on the economy that I probably don't give them a fair hearing, because they get on my nerves.

That said, I'm pretty impressed by some of the experiments that have popped up in the last two years, such as some of the projects highlighted by Bria. And so a part of me hasn't been in any rush to do some of the hard, headbanging-against-wall analysis it would take to come up with a smart market proposal. I'd rather wait for a bit and see how some of these on the ground efforts pan out.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>California: We&#039;re #1... in Poverty</title>

				On the same day as Apple unveiled the expensive iPhone in Apple's history, Southern California Public Radio released a sobering <a href="https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/09/12/75575/california-s-housing-costs-are-driving-its-no-1-po/">analysis</a>.

<blockquote>
  New figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show California has the country's highest poverty rate, with nearly one in five residents facing economic hardship when factoring in living costs such as housing.
</blockquote>

Most of the time we talk about poverty in terms of how much money people are making. But the Census Bureau also has a "Supplemental Poverty Measure" that does a better job at getting at how poor people really are by factoring in the cost of housing, taxes, and medical care. And by this more realistic standard, California is doing worse than Mississippi.

The main culprit: the astronomical cost of housing in California.

<blockquote>
  The California Budget and Policy Center blamed high rents for keeping 20.4 percent of the population in poverty. Sara Kimberlin, a senior policy analyst at the center, said fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the most populated parts of the state is more than $1,500 a month. But the state minimum wage pays $546 a month, meaning that a single mother earning that income, for example, wouldn't be able to find an affordable place for herself and her children.
</blockquote>

What's particularly shocking about this turn of events is that California housing prices used to be quite reasonable. When I was in grad school in the mid-80s to early 90s, rent in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco was remarkably cheap. If you work willing to share a house with a few roommates, you could have a remarkably comfortable middle-class life on not a whole lot of money.  But when Silicon Valley took off, a combination of an explosion of new wealth, not enough housing being built to keep up with a partly tech-driven increase in population, and outdated housing policies pushed housing prices so high that now almost no one can afford it.  It's a very sad state of affairs, and it's not at all clear how they can get out from under.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>When You Can Afford to Wait, When You Can&#039;t</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				There's an important lesson for Makers All in the tragedy of <a href="/2017/09/13/california-were-1-in-poverty/">California's abysmal poverty rate</a>: sometimes you can wait to deal with a slow building crisis, and sometimes you can't.

When the cost of housing started rising in Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley techies and investors didn't pay any attention. When everyone is working crazy hours -- and everyone is preaching that what they're doing is going to revolutionize society -- nobody wanted to stop and ask, how are we shaping society? And you can't talk about housing costs without talking about land regulations and other issues that have to do with government, and everybody in Silicon Valley was smugly confident that government was too slow to waste time paying attention to. Besides, if your motto is "move fast and break things," your hidden assumption is that you can always easily fix what you broke later.

But land and housing aren't fluid the way software and hardware is. And as Silicon Valley's newfound wealth collided with scarce housing, the cost of housing took off like a rocket. And once an area has been built up and housing has become insanely expensive, fixing what you broke is damn near impossible.

The same was true with Bay Area progressives, especially in San Francisco and Berkeley. Their mantra was "think globally, act locally" -- and by "locally" they meant just their city. Before I left the Bay Area I was briefly involved with some progressive groups in Silicon Valley, and I was always amazed at how completely uninterested progressives in San Francisco and Berkeley were in what was happening right next door to them. They knew a lot more about the Sandinistas than they did about Silicon Valley. Between that and a shortsighted focus on rent control to the exclusion of broader housing strategies, they were completely unprepared as Silicon Valley's housing prices started applying pressure to the very affordable housing markets of Berkeley and San Francisco (when I was a grad student in the 80s and early 90s, if you didn't mind living in group houses you could survive quite comfortably on a tiny salary). At some level, they were making the same mistake as Silicon Valley techies: they assumed they could always worry about Silicon Valley and housing prices later.

It's understandable that both of these groups made this mistake. But when it comes to the potential threat of mass unemployment due to robots and AI, we can't afford to repeat it. We need to be asking ourselves now, what are the decisions we can wait to make, and what decisions and actions do we need to start taking in the next few years? Because what's at stake here isn't whether California housing will be affordable, it's whether our society and our democracy will survive.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Communties, Not Just Individuals:  Black, Latino Median Wealth Is Headed Towards Zero</title>

				Some shocking news from a <a href="https://prosperitynow.org/files/PDFs/road_to_zero_wealth.pdf">new study</a>: not only is the wealth gap between black and Latino families vs white families not shrinking, it's actually getting  much worse.

<blockquote>
  Between 1983 and 2013, the wealth of median Black and Latino households decreased by 75% (from $6,800 to $1,700) and 50% (from $4,000 to $2,000), respectively, while median White household wealth rose by 14% (from $102,200 to $116,800). If current trends continue, by 2020 median Black and Latino households stand to lose nearly 18% and 12%, respectively, of the wealth they held in 2013. In that same timeframe, median White household wealth would see an increase of 3%. Put differently, in just under four years from now, median White households are projected to own 86 and 68 times more wealth than Black and Latino households, respectively....
  
  Earning a middle-class income does not guarantee middle-class economic security. White households in the middle-income quintile (those earning $37,201-$61,328 annually) own nearly eight times as much wealth ($86,100) as middle-income Black earners ($11,000) and ten times as much wealth as middle-income Latino earners ($8,600). This disconnect in income earned and wealth owned is visible across the entire income spectrum between these groups....
  
  If the racial wealth divide is left unaddressed and is not exacerbated further over the next eight years, median Black household wealth is on a path to hit zero by 2053—about 10 years after it is projected that racial minorities will comprise the majority of the nation’s population. Median Latino household wealth is projected to hit zero twenty years later, or by 2073. In sharp contrast, median White household wealth would climb to $137,000 by 2053 and $147,000 by 2073.
</blockquote>

This is another example of why it's absolutely crucial that will we talk about access, we talk about communities and not just individuals. There are number of really terrific programs that are teaching folks across the country in poor communities how to code. That's all to the good. But that was also true when the Internet started to take off. And yet African-American and Latino communities ended up with less wealth. We can't  repeat that mistake when it comes to robots, AI, and the other emerging tech that will dominate the economy in the next 20 years.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Unity: Come for the AR, Stay for the AI</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				If you want to develop something for augmented reality (AR), these days there's a pretty good chance you're using the gaming engine called <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. Unity is the closest we've got to cross-platform AR; if you build something in Unity, it'll work on Apple, Google, and Microsoft Hololens.  This week, Unity added a new twist:  <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/09/19/introducing-unity-machine-learning-agents/">Unity machine learning agents</a>

<blockquote>
  Machine Learning is changing the way we expect to get intelligent behavior out of autonomous agents. Whereas in the past the behavior was coded by hand, it is increasingly taught to the agent (either a robot or virtual avatar) through interaction in a training environment. This method is used to learn behavior for everything from industrial robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles, to game characters and opponents...
  
  At Unity, we wanted to design a system that provide greater flexibility and ease-of-use to the growing groups interested in applying machine learning to developing intelligent agents...
  * Academic researchers interested in studying complex multi-agent behavior in realistic competitive and cooperative scenarios.
  * Industry researchers interested in large-scale parallel training regimes for robotics, autonomous vehicle, and other industrial applications.
  * Game developers interested in filling virtual worlds with intelligent agents each acting with dynamic and engaging behavior.
</blockquote>

Unity's machine learning agents are a long way from being finished. Unity is releasing their work as a beta (including, interestingly enough, open sourcing the software). But it should have some very interesting implications for Makers All down the line. As I discussed in <a href="/2017/08/18/on-augmented-reality-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">On Augmented Reality and Not Sitting at the Back of the Bus</a> and <a href="/2017/08/24/why-augmented-realty-instead-of-robots/">Why Augmented Reality Instead of Robots</a>, given the very limited things robots that are ridiculously expensive can do today, I think augmented reality is a better place for working on the issue of community access right now. I'd assumed that at some point the lessons learned from community groups working together around augmented reality would be useful when robots and AI got interesting enough to start to do real work on them in the community. But given Unity's announcement, there may be a lot more overlap than I expected.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is Coding Literacy for All a Silicon Valley Plot To Lower Tech Wages?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/Drevil_million_dollars.jpg
Last week, the Guardian published a piece <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/21/coding-education-teaching-silicon-valley-wages">arguing</a> that organizations like code.org are essentially a nefarious plot to push down programmers' wages:

<blockquote>
  Contrary to public perception, the economy doesn’t actually need that many more programmers. As a result, teaching millions of kids to code won’t make them all middle-class. Rather, it will proletarianize the profession by flooding the market and forcing wages down – and that’s precisely the point....
  
  Guest workers and wage-fixing are useful tools for restraining labor costs. But nothing would make programming cheaper than making millions more programmers. And where better to develop this workforce than America’s schools? It’s no coincidence, then, that the campaign for code education is being orchestrated by the tech industry itself. Its primary instrument is Code.org, a nonprofit funded by Facebook, Microsoft, Google and others. In 2016, the organization spent nearly $20m on training teachers, developing curricula, and lobbying policymakers.
</blockquote>

If Silicon Valley was conspiring to drive down how much they spend on coders, I think they could figure out a strategy that would take a little less than 18 years to pay off. Take IBM.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/technology/ibm-india.html">According</a> to the New York Times, IBM now

<blockquote>
  employs 130,000 people in India — about one-third of its total work force, and more than in any other country. Their work spans the entire gamut of IBM’s businesses, from managing the computing needs of global giants like AT&amp;T and Shell to performing cutting-edge research in fields like visual search, artificial intelligence and computer vision for self-driving cars. One team is even working with the producers of Sesame Street to teach vocabulary to kindergartners in Atlanta....
  
  The tech industry has been shifting jobs overseas for decades, and other big American companies like Oracle and Dell also employ a majority of their workers outside the United States. But IBM is unusual because it employs more people in a single foreign country than it does at home. The company’s employment in India has nearly doubled since 2007, even as its work force in the United States has shrunk through waves of layoffs and buyouts. Although IBM refuses to disclose exact numbers, outsiders estimate that it employs well under 100,000 people at its American offices now, down from 130,000 in 2007. Depending on the job, the salaries paid to Indian workers are one-half to one-fifth those paid to Americans, according to data posted by the research firm Glassdoor.
</blockquote>

You can certainly make a reasonable argument that teaching lots of people to code has more complex motives an ideological impact than simply trying to help lots of people learn to code, and the author also makes that point in the article. But the idea that organizations like code.org are primarily about driving down wages is just nuts.

More importantly, I think the author is ignoring an important economic impact if everyone learned to code. In the next 20 years we are going to see a remarkable rise of new technology: robots, AI, augmented reality, virtual reality, wearables, and digital fabrication. In this context, if most people learn to code it could fundamentally transform what might be possible in the same way that learning to read and write did on the previous economy. Given that all of these new technologies are driven by code, massively increasing the number of people who know how to do so might not only not draft wages down, they could help generate an unprecedented amount of wealth (in a similar way that California community colleges helped enable the rise of Silicon Valley).

How this would play out isn't inevitable; it would depend in no small part on whether ordinary people were able to build the kind of economic power in this new economy that white blue color workers were able to build in the 40s and 50s through their unions. But there's no reason why liberals or lefties should see the possibility of mass coding literacy as an evil capitalist plot.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Time to Drop &quot;Make Creativity Work&quot; and &quot;Make Community Work&quot;?</title>

				Although I like the ideas incorporated in Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work, I'm beginning to think they aren't the right way to frame these ideas.

I've been spending some time working on article queries as well as talking points, and the more I work with Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work, the more I think I'm to trying to pack in too many ideas. Each of them takes 3 bullet points to explain; that's six in total. Add in an intro and other pieces that I need, and that's an awful lot to digest.

Also,  Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work are built on a series of assumptions that most people don't make -- e.g., why it's important to build grassroots power at the heart of the economy the way unions did in the 40s and 50s. These assumptions make sense to most folks once they understand them, but that takes a bunch of explanation. As a result, it's hard to concisely explain Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work: they require too much set up/context.

The other problem I'm running into is that because Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work have so many working parts, some of the points that are most important for me to highlight feel like they get lost in the shuffle. For example, almost no one who talks about the potential impact of robots talks about the importance of building grassroots power in the heart of the economy -- or for that matter talks much about economic power at all.

Finally, I've never been entirely happy with the contrast between Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work. The word "creativity" plays a critical role in Make Creativity Work, but it's always felt like someone to get the idea that I think the work that is covered in Make Community Work -- e.g., taking care of kids or the elderly -- isn't creative. That's definitely not the case, but given the history of male policy writers undervaluing what's been traditionally seen as women's work, I'm not entirely comfortable with it.

If I stop using Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work, what do I use instead? I don't yet have short/snappy phrases to describe the new approach, but I think I can cover everything that's critical in three buckets:

1) In every community, ensure that as many individuals as possible can learn the skills they need to participate in this economy -- not only as tool users but as tool creators. This is critical not only so folks can make $$$, but also it's needed for #2.

2) Build grassroots power at the heart of this to economy the way unions did in the 40s and 50s, only this time build power that includes every community. The goal: to ensure that everyone, not just a handful of corporations and the wealthy, gets a seat at the table with the decisions get made about how markets for this new economy will be structured and who will benefit (e.g., "YouTube Done Right"). And by ensuring that everyone will be empowered in this new economy generate unprecedented wealth.

3) Make Communities Whole. To guarantee everyone security, create a backstop, such as a mix of a Universal Basic Income and other opportunities that anyone could do and that reinforce our society's values (e.g., “volunteer bucks"). Also provide resources for critical work the market doesn’t fully value, such as taking care of children and the elderly. And for communities that are devastated either by new crises, such as mass unemployment from robots, or have never recovered from previous damage, create a mini Marshall plan to get them back on their feet.

My first thoughts about this potential approach:

<ul>
<li>Although these three buckets still cover a lot of territory, I feel like I can streamline them enough that they will be easier for folks to wrap their heads around.</p></li>
<li><p>It feels like I'll be able to more easily and more quickly &amp; concisely lay out the assumptions behind each bucket. I won't know for sure until I try, but it feels like rather than having a big, blobby set of assumptions followed by a lot of points and sub points, I should be able to end up with a nice clean table that encapsulates both the assumptions and the buckets.</p></li>
<li><p>My <a href="/ma-framework/">full version of the framework</a> does a pretty good job of framing the Makers All argument in a historical context, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do that in a more concise version -- because my old framework covered so many points, the connections between the history and the points of the framework were too complicated to come up with a clean diagram. With a new approach, it feels like I might be able to pull that off.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not bad for a first take! I'll do a deeper dive next week, and by the end of the week I should have a first real draft of this new approach.		]]></content:encoded>

				Turns out I didn't need to <a href="/2017/09/29/time-to-chuck-make-creativity-work-and-make-community-work/">drop Make Creativity Work or Make Community Work</a>. Once I wrote up the problems I was having with them, I realized that with some changes to the setup and some changes to both parts of the model, most of the problems went away. Below is my quick and dirty, short version of my revised framework. I'll post a more fleshed out version in the coming weeks.

<hr />

Many experts believe that between 2025 and 2040, 25-75% of all jobs will be replaced by robots/AI. Given that the rules of our economy already concentrate wealth and power at the top, this crisis could end up devastating the middle class and the poor and destroying our democracy. But not all experts agree that robots/AI could bring about mass unemployment, and there's no way to know who's right. So, we need a strategy for building a more just, prosperous economy for all regardless of whether robots/AI create an unemployment crisis.

The solution: Makers All.

To understand why Makers All is structured the way it is, we need to understand the economic backdrop that shapes it:

<ul>
<li>Not only robots and AI but also augmented and virtual reality, digital fabrication, wearables, and other emerging technologies are going to become the core of this new economy. The most valuable part of this economy won't be physical products but the creative works that power them: a robot's software that lets it cook, the recipe that tells it how to make tomato soup, the patent behind sensors that lets it know when a chicken breast is fully cooked. </li>
<li>The Internet has given us a sneak preview of what an economy dominated by creative works might look like. With websites, YouTube, and open source software, we have an unprecedented bounty of creative works at our fingertips. But the financial benefits have largely gone to the top:  musicians, newspaper reporters, and other makers of creative works have a harder time paying the bills, income inequality has soared, and communities from Compton to Harlan County have essentially been written off.</li>
<li>But as the postwar consumer economy showed us, technology isn't destiny. Through their unions, millions of white Americans built grassroots power at the heart of this new economy that ensured this prosperity was more broadly shared. The challenge we face today is how to build grassroots power at the heart of the creative works economy -- and do it in a way so this time every community benefits</li>
</ul>

Makers All consists of 2 strategies:

<strong>Make Creativity Work</strong>.  How do we ensure that in every community, as many people as possible can earn some or all of their income from creative works?

<ul>
<li><em>Knowledge</em>. In every community, ensure that as many individuals as possible can learn the skills they need to participate in this economy both as tool users and tool creators -- and rewire tech culture to support it. This knowledge is critical not only so people can benefit financially but also for the second part of Make Creativity Work: building power. </li>
<li><em>Power</em>. Organize within and across communities to build grassroots power at the heart of this new economy. The goal: to ensure that everyone, not just a handful of corporations and the wealthy, gets a seat at the table where decisions get made about how the rules governing creative works are structured and who benefits (e.g., "YouTube Done Right").</li>
</ul>

<em>Make Community Work</em>.  Although every community should benefit from Make Creativity Work, not every individual will benefit enough to pay the bills and not everything we value will pay -- and the harder hit our society is by job losses, the more critical this problem will become. So we need another way to make sure nobody starves and everyone has a shot at making it:

<ul>
<li><em>Fill the Gaps</em>. Guarantee everyone security through a mix of a smaller Universal Basic Income and other opportunities that anyone could do and that reinforce our society's values (e.g., “volunteer bucks"). Provide resources for work that's critical to our communities but that the market doesn’t value, such as taking care of children and the elderly. And reduce our need for income through personal digital fabrication, creating more affordable housing, etc.</li>
<li><em>Make Communities Whole</em>. Create Marshall Plan-style transitions for communities who are hit hard by new robot-driven job crises or were previously Left behind.</li>
</ul>		]]></content:encoded>

Yesterday, Facebook made a big splash with its <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/pioneering-the-frontier-of-vr-introducing-oculus-go-plus-santa-cruz-updates/">announcement</a> of Oculus Go, a lightweight, standalone virtual reality headset that doesn't require a cable and a PC or a smartphone.

<blockquote>
  It ships early next year, starting at $199 USD. It’s awesome for watching movies or concerts, playing games, or just hanging out with your friends in VR....  The high-resolution fast-switch LCD screen dramatically improves visual clarity and reduces screen door effect....  Oculus Go also ships with integrated spatial audio. The speakers are built right into the headset, transporting you straight into VR and making the headset easy to share with someone else.
</blockquote>

<a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-oculus-go/">According</a> to the Oculus Developer blog, you can use either the Unity or Unreal gaming engine to develop for the Oculus Go. All of the big players in augmented reality support at least Unity, which means you should be able to develop in Unity and, with some tweaking, get it to work across both augmented reality and the Facebook virtual reality devices.

If the hype around Oculus Go is anywhere near reality, Oculus Go should end up seriously cranking up the competition over virtual and augmented reality, creating even more room for <a href="/2017/08/18/on-augmented-reality-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">communities that work together to start building a seat at the table</a>		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>With No More Human Opponents, AlphaGo Kicks Its Own Ass </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				This week, Google announced a pretty remarkable breakthrough.  According to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/10/18/google_s_ai_made_some_pretty_huge_leaps_this_week.html">Slate</a>:

<blockquote>
  The newest version of [Google's] Go-playing algorithm, dubbed AlphaGo Zero, was not only better than the original AlphaGo, which defeated the world’s best human player in May. This version had taught itself how to play the game. All on its own, given only the basic rules of the game. (The original, by comparison, learned from a database of 100,000 Go games.) According to Google’s researchers, AlphaGo Zero has achieved superhuman-level performance: It won 100–0 against its champion predecessor, AlphaGo.
</blockquote>

Almost as impressive, AlphaGo Zero did it using fewer computer chips, aka TPUs:

<blockquote>
  Early AlphaGo versions operated on 48 Google-built TPUs. AlphaGo Zero works on only four. It’s far more efficient and practical than its predecessors.
</blockquote>

Maybe estimates of mass unemployemnt in 20 years are feeling like a pretty reasonable forecast (even though nobody really knows for sure).

<hr>

UPDATE:  so this is a little creepy.  From the <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/">Deepmind blog</a>:

<blockquote>
  After just three days of self-play training, AlphaGo Zero emphatically defeated the previously published version of AlphaGo - which had itself defeated 18-time world champion Lee Sedol - by 100 games to 0. After 40 days of self training, AlphaGo Zero became even stronger, outperforming the version of AlphaGo known as “Master”, which has defeated the world's best players and world number one Ke Jie.
</blockquote>

3 days to achieve a higher level of mastery of a complex game than most humans have, without any tactical or strategic advice, just being told the rules?  That's pretty wild.  What this means is that if you can create an accurate enough simulation of a real world problem, an AI has a good chance of being able to master it on its own in a matter of days or months (the AI needs a simulation so it can learn by playing a bazillion games against itself).  

This won't be true for all problems.  For example, in Go you only move one piece at a time, the environment is far less complex than, say, driving, and it may have real world hardware problems -- e.g. sensors that don't work well in the snow, or not being able to process data fast enough to react quickly enough to unexpected problems -- that may limit what it can do.  But it's still a pretty impressive/creepy accomplishment.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>It&#039;s Not Just Go: OpenAI&#039;s AI Competes Against Top Dota2 Gamers</title>

AlphaGo Zero isn't the only AI learning to kick butt by playing against itself.  Back in <a href="https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/">August</a>, OpenAI announced they'd used a similar strategy in the video game Dota 2:

<blockquote>
  We’ve created a bot which beats the world’s top professionals at 1v1 matches of Dota 2 under standard tournament rules. The bot learned the game from scratch by self-play, and does not use imitation learning or tree search. This is a step towards building AI systems which accomplish well-defined goals in messy, complicated situations involving real humans.
  
  Today we played Dendi on mainstage at The International, winning a best-of-three match. Over the past week, our bot was undefeated against many top professionals including SumaiL (top 1v1 player in the world) and Arteezy (top overall player in the world).
  
  Dota 1v1 is a complex game with hidden information. Agents must learn to plan, attack, trick, and deceive their opponents. The correlation between player skill and actions-per-minute is not strong, and in fact, our AI’s actions-per-minute are comparable to that of an average human player.
</blockquote>

What's equally impressive is <a href="https://blog.openai.com/more-on-dota-2/">how  fast</a> their AI improved its game.  By the beginning of March, they had a "classical reinforcement learning" able to play a bit of Dota 2.  By early June it was able to beat a tester who was in the bottom 15% skill rank. By the  end of June it could beat a tester who was as good as around 60% of all players.  By mid July it could barely eke out a win against a tester in the top 99%.  And then:

<blockquote>
  In the span of a month, our system went from barely matching a high-ranked player to beating the top pros and has continued to improve since then.
</blockquote>

So far the AI can only handle one-on-one Dota 2 matches.  Their next challenge:  competing in five-on-five matches.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Our Robots, Ourselves</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				One of Makers All's core assumptions is that there's no reason developing robots and AI can't be accessible to a much wider audience. Some people think that's crazy; only an expert could possibly understand this tax.

Back in the early 60s, that's exactly how most folks thought about medicine.  Nancy Miriam Hawley <a href="http://www.bu.edu/wgs/files/2013/10/Ditzion-Formative-Years-The-Birth-of-Our-Bodies-Ourselves.pdf">recalls</a> recalls an encounter she had with her OB/GYN:

<blockquote>Imagine me as a 23 year old professional young woman asking a question after the doctor (he) recommended that I use a new –to- market pill for birth control.  What’s in this pill? I ask.  His response: condescending pat on my head and literally said “don’t worry your pretty little head!”</blockquote>

Minus the head pat, that was pretty much the standard answer doctors were expected to give. They had years and years of intensive training. How could anyone -- let alone a woman -- be expected to have any real say in their treatment given that they couldn't possibly understand medicine?

In 1969, Hawley and several other women who had met at a women's conference decided it was  <a href="http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/history/preface-to-the-1973-edition-of-our-bodies-ourselves/"> time for a change</a>.

<blockquote>We had all experienced similar feelings of frustration and anger toward specific doctors and the medical maze in general, and initially we wanted to do something about those doctors who were condescending, paternalistic, judgmental and noninformative. As we talked and shared our experiences with one another, we realized just how much we had to learn about our bodies. So we decided on a summer project: to research those topics which we felt were particularly pertinent to learning about our bodies, to discuss in the group what we had learned, then to write papers individually or in groups of two or three, and finally to present the results in the fall as a course for women on women and their bodies.

As we developed the course we realized more and more that we really were capable of collecting, understanding, and evaluating medical information. Together we evaluated our reading of books and journals, our talks with doctors and friends who were medical students. We found we could discuss, question, and argue with each other in a new spirit of cooperation rather than competition. We were equally struck by how important it was for us to be able to open up with one another and share our feelings about our bodies. The process of talking was as crucial as the facts themselves. Over time the facts and feelings melted together in ways that touched us very deeply, and that is reflected in the changing titles of the course and then the book, from “Women and Their Bodies” to “Women and Our Bodies” to, finally, “Our Bodies, Ourselves.”</blockquote>

Today, the idea that we couldn't understand enough about medicine to have an informed opinion seems about as antiquated as using leeches. In fact, these days you can even get a degree in the art and science of making medical information  accessible to the public.

And as complex as robotics and AI are, it's not in the same league as medicine. To understand the human body, you need to understand biology, physics, chemistry, psychology, statistics, etc. In fact, medicine is so complex that even someone with years and years of training in one medical specialty isn't qualified to have an expert opinion about another specialty.

So the next time someone talking about robots or AI does the equivalent of patting you on the head, remember that the only reason that they can get away with it is that we are just at the beginning of a movement that's committed to do in robotics and AI what those women did "about those doctors who were condescending, paternalistic, judgmental and noninformative."		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Last week I got a new iPhone that's augmented reality (AR) friendly. For the first 20 minutes, I was giggling like a little boy -- in no small part because I had dinosaurs wandering around my kitchen.

40 minutes later, after downloading the top rated apps: all I could do with AR is play games, see what furniture I might purchase would look like in my rooms, and draw in the air.

Microsoft's decision to skip a version of Hololens and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/20/14667306/microsoft-hololens-v2-rumors-2019">wait until 2019</a> before releasing their headset to the general public now makes a whole lot more sense. I'm sure we will see some cool AR apps for smart phones in the next year, but the development tech for building them is still pretty primitive. And the more I played with my iPhone, the more obvious the limitations of doing AR through a tiny window became.

This week, we learned that Apple came to the same conclusion. They <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/08/apple-augmented-reality-headset-ros/">leaked</a> that they're going to come out with a headset sometime -- they hope -- in 2020.

Given the news that's been coming out around VR, I think the same is probably true there: the tech is almost here, but not quite.

This is kind of a bummer for people who are into AR or VR. But for communities that our society has essentially written off? It's perfect timing. AR and VR are just beginning to take off, but they still have a ways to go. That means there's plenty of time for these communities to take a shot at fully participating in this new economic opportunity by <a href="/2017/08/18/on-augmented-reality-and-not-sitting-at-the-back-of-the-bus/">getting a seat at the front of the economic bus</a>.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Building Corporate Structures Vs. Grassroots Power</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				After I told a smart friend about the work I'm doing around Makers All, she asked me if I'd spent any time thinking about what kind of corporate/organizational structures we'd want to create. When I first started Makers All, I assumed I'd be spending a lot of time on it. Now I'm more focused on how to build grassroots power. There are three reasons why I've made the switch.

First, it doesn't make sense to me to spend a lot of time sweating the details on policy when you don't have the community power to fight and win them. DC and academia are filled with lots of great ideas that go nowhere; I don't want to add to the collection.

Second, if by some miracle your policy ideas you start to gain traction but there isn't a movement or other political power that has the muscle and commitment to make them happen, there's a decent chance they'll be used to do the opposite of what you wanted. Powerful political players often twist ideas to suit their parochial interests or to provide cover for their real interests -- e.g., promoting "family farms" to subsidize Big Ag and further undermine family farms.

Third, I think some of the best ideas for rethinking corporate structure will come out of the day-to-day struggles to make things happen -- and that will include trying to get folks to sign up to fight to change things. For example, good corporate structures need to be both economically and politically sustainable. There's nothing like being in political street fights to make you acutely aware of how structures make those fights easier or harder.

I don't mean to denigrate the work that other folks may be doing around rethinking corporate structures. I certainly think it could be useful. But our side tends to spend too much time thinking about building ideas and not enough time on thinking about how to build the grassroots power needed to make those ideas a reality. It's time to change the equation.		]]></content:encoded>

				After a lot of blood, sweat, and tears,  a new version of my framework! I finally decided to get rid of Make Creativity Work and Make Community Work in favor of a more streamlined approach that's also more deeply rooted in our history. I've probably got another year's worth of work before I can say it "tight and bright." But this is a significant step forward.

<hr />

Many experts believe that between 2025 and 2040, 25-75% of all jobs will be replaced by robots/AI. Given that the rules of our economy already concentrate wealth and power at the top, this crisis could end up devastating the middle class and the poor and destroying our democracy. But not all experts agree that robots/AI could bring about mass unemployment, and there's no way to know who's right.

If you don't know if it'll rain tomorrow and you can't afford to get wet, the smart thing to do is bring a small umbrella.   It's time to stop obsessing over trying to predict the future and start focusing on creating a strategy to build more just, prosperous economy regardless of whether robots and AI destroy many jobs. In short, it's time for Makers All.

<h2>Our Values</h2>

Before we explore solutions, first we need to ask, what values do we want a more just, prosperous economy to support? Makers All argues for the following:

<ul>
<li>From Harlem to Harlan County, ensure no community is left behind -- and heal the damage already inflicted by white supremacy and deindustrialization</li>
<li>Provide income security regardless of how many jobs are eliminated</li>
<li>Give everyone a chance to express their creativity, to explore their full potential, and contribute to society</li>
</ul>

Makers All's strategy for building a economy that supports these values is based on 3 pillars: security, knowledge, and power.

<h2>Pillar #1: Security</h2>

First and foremost, we need to guarantee everyone has enough to live on regardless of how many jobs are eliminated:
- Provide everyone a Universal Basic Income so no one starves
- If robots/AI create mass unemployment, create opportunities to earn more income that anyone can take advantage of and that strengthen communities (e.g., "volunteer bucks", income for taking care of children and the elderly). The extent to which we need to create these opportunities will depend in part on how successful the next 2 Pillars are at creating broad-based prosperity.
- Reduce the amount of income we need to live a good life: <a href="/2017/07/04/fab-labs-and-the-future-of-makers-all/">personal digital fabrication</a>, affordable housing, etc.

In doing so, we can also give everyone the flexibility of not having to work 40 hours a week and shift the focus of our efforts from ensuring there are enough good paying jobs to ensuring income security for all.

<h2>Why Security Isn't Enough</h2>

Most debates about mitigating robots' impact stop here. But in an economy where robots/AI are ubiquitous, just focusing on security leaves most of the power of this new economy in the hands of a small elite. This would be dangerous even if robots don't create mass unemployment. But remember Mitt Romney's makers vs. takers? Now imagine an economy where more and more people will never have a job. This is a recipe for disaster.

The last time many people in our society were economically secure -- the decades right after World War II --  it was in no small part because in the 1930s and 40s unions built grassroots power at the heart of the economy. By the 1930s, automation and mechanization were deskilling many jobs and pushing down wages. But by organizing both skilled and semiskilled workers within a factory, white workers were able to force corporations to share the profits workers had helped create. The main challenge we face today is how to build a new form of grassroots power at the heart of the new economy regardless of how many jobs are eliminated -- and ensure that this time everyone benefits.

But how do we build grassroots power in an economy dominated by robots and AI if only a handful of people know how to make robots and AI? The answer is Pillar #2: democratize the technology in such a way that everyone benefits.

<h2>Pillar #2: Knowledge</h2>

Making and editing videos used to be a skill only a few possessed. Today it's so accessible that it's possible to make a living making/editing videos without years of formal training (although highly trained professionals still occupy a major economic niche). Is something similar with robots and AI -- or for that matter, with augmented and virtual reality, digital fabrications, wearables, and other emerging technologies that are going to become the core of the new economy? And can we do it in a way that also lays the groundwork for building grassroots power at the heart of this new economy?

We aren't the first people to wrestle with the issue of how to democratize technology. From the 19th century agrarian Populists to the early 20th century <a href="/2017/06/28/mary-mims-and-the-radical-side-of-agrculture-extension-services/">Agricultural Extension Services</a> to the the popular health education movement <a href="/2017/11/02/our-robots-ourselves/">started by Our Bodies, Ourselves in the 1970s</a>, we already know how to make complex technical knowledge accessible to a wide audience.

If we apply these lessons from the past, we can revolutionize the world of programming. We can rewire tech culture to prioritize building coding tools that are widely accessible and create an ecosystem around these tools that smooths the learning curve between levels of technical expertise. In doing so, we can ensure that in every community, as many individuals as possible can participate in the new economy both as tool users and tool creators.

But words alone won't convince people that this coding revolution is possible; it's going to take real-world examples. That's why Makers All is beginning work on spinning up apart project to demonstrate what's possible.

Finally, as important as it is to reduce the gap in technical know-how, we also need to shift the way we think about worker retraining. Today we often use an individualized, atomized model of "lifelong learning," where workers must keep swimming towards a life raft as one economic wave after the other sweeps them out of it. Instead, we needed approach designed to knit communities back together by building a community-based ecosystem that not only teaches people to use in make tools but also how to build businesses, economic power, and strengthen citizenship. Or to put it another way, what if vocational education and worker retraining were designed like the 1960s Civil Right Movement's citizenship schools?

<h2>Pillar #3: Power</h2>

To understand how to build grassroots power at the heart of this new economy, first you need to understand the new economy's dynamics. Over the next 20 years, not only robots and AI but also augmented and virtual reality, digital fabrication, wearables, and other emerging technologies will become ubiquitous. In this new economy, the greatest value won't come from physical products but from the creative works that power them: a robot's software that lets it cook, the recipe that tells it how to make tomato soup, the patent for sensors that lets it know when a chicken breast is done.

The Internet has given us a sneak preview of what an economy dominated by creative works could look like. With websites, YouTube, and open source software, we have an unprecedented bounty of creative works at our fingertips. But the financial benefits have largely gone to the top:  musicians, newspaper reporters, and other makers of creative works have a harder time paying the bills, income inequality has soared, and communities from Compton to Detroit have essentially been written off.

To avoid a future that looks like the present, we need to build grassroots power within and across communities. The goal: to ensure that everyone, not just a handful of corporations and the wealthy, gets a seat at the table where decisions get made about the legal and de facto rules governing creative works so that both the creative bounty and the profits are widely shared (e.g., "YouTube Done Right").  As we attempt to do so, we may be able to learn important lessons from the successes and failures of late 19th-century populist movements who faced surprisingly similar economic challenges.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Digital Music Economy Is Still A Hot Mess</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/the-digital-music-economy-is-still-a-hot-mess/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Music reporter Cherie Hu was recently <a href="https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/8054732/how-a-youtube-video-sparked-a-decades-old-music">invited to attend</a> the annual Roundtable Conference, an international "music industry symposium focused on copyright."  What she learned is that the industry is basically stuck.

After suffering from shock and awe in the Napster era -- in no small part because most powerful players the music industry either had their heads in the sand or were treating the customers like the enemy -- by the 2010s, as streaming took off, Roundtable participants seemed pretty upbeat and hopeful about developing solutions that were sustainable. But by this year, they "[seemed] to revert back towards the pessimism and stagnation of a decade prior." Why?

<blockquote>
  A music industry consultant at the Roundtable suggested that streaming’s initial, rosy promise to rights holders has since been overshadowed by disillusionment around messy data and the compensation challenges that result. “We’re still only at the beginning of the innovation bell curve,” she said. “It took until 2015 -- 15 years! -- for labels to admit that on-demand streaming was here to stay. Then came 2016, which was an ‘oh shit’ moment when labels realized that they weren’t prepared to process and analyze the vast swaths of data that were coming in, nor were they equipped to make sure the money was flowing properly through the pipes.”
</blockquote>

And so the industry began to veer back towards a Game of Thrones approach to their common problem.

<blockquote>
  As a result, a behemoth, fragmented rights management landscape has cemented itself even further into the industry’s core.... Interestingly, the majority of Roundtable participants agreed that a global rights database -- the long-glorified concept of a single, authoritative registry that would reduce ambiguity around ownership and revenue splits across organizations -- was no longer a feasible solution for the music business, both technologically and politically. Many participants argued not only that non-disclosure agreements essentially force labels and publishers to resist creating a public database, but also that unattributable royalties (commonly referred to as “black-box money”) gets distributed on market share if unclaimed after a few years, which benefits bigger labels and actually gives them incentives to provide bad data.
  
  In fact, there has been a marked attitude change in the industry overall around data quality, such that umbrella organizations are beginning to compete, rather than cooperate, on accuracy and trust. The RIAA and NMPA have banded against the ASCAP-BMI duo on building their own separate databases, presumably more for strategic advantage than for the betterment of the wider music landscape....
  
  Many Roundtable participants also pointed to how the pessimism in the music industry comes not just from the lack of good data and surrounding incentives, but also around the culpability of streaming services in devaluing music and making the consumption experience less personal, particularly for DIY and niche communities. An executive from a European PRO, calling himself a “student of history,” recalled that the music industry’s solution for digging itself out of its historic recession in the 1920s was to cater to niche genres. “Now, I’m afraid we’ve found ourselves at the tail end of a similar financial situation, but have the opposite solution of going towards safer, mass-market music, which has the effect of making the average music listener more indifferent,” he said. “We’ve gone from curating music that people really love to curating music that people simply don’t hate.”
</blockquote>

It's not that there aren't any attempts to create a more healthy solution. For example, Hu mentions the <a href="http://open-music.org/">Open Music Initiative</a>, "a historic, top-level initiative bringing together over 140 member organizations, from major labels and publishers to early-stage startups, dedicated to rights management reform." But efforts like these were not discussed in the Roundtable conversations, and most participants seemed unaware of them. All in all, pretty sad state of affairs.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Agricultural Extension Services&#039; History Can Teach Us about Democratizing Technology</title>

				http://www.argenweb.net/white/wchs/Agri_Extentsion_History/image50.jpg

Could millions of American workers could take full advantage of the emerging tech that's going to dominate our economy in the next 20 years? That might sound crazy to you. But this isn't the first time we've had to figure out how to make tech accessible to a daunting number of people. US agriculture went through an extraordinary transformation from the mid-19th to the early 20th century, producing one of the biggest explosions in productivity that the world had ever seen.  To make it happen, farmers throughout the US had to adopt and master one wave of technological &amp; process change after another. And that couldn't have happened without several institutions, culminating in Agricultural Extension Services. To bring about the same kind of radical transformation, we can learn a thing or two from their experience.

Agriculture Extension Services were the third wave of institutions intended to bring the agricultural technological revolution of automation and mechanization to millions of American farmers. The 1862 Morrill Act allowed states to use the funds from selling public lands to establish "land-grant colleges" to teach agricultural and mechanical arts. Although a good start, not enough farmers could afford to take the time to go to college. So in 1877, the Hatch Act gave states the ability to create agricultural experimentation stations to conduct agricultural research and share that knowledge with students and farmers. But the knowledge still wasn't reaching enough people. So in 1914 the Smith-Lever Act helped land-grant colleges and the USDA cooperate to make sure the knowledge/tech coming out of experimental research stations got into the hands of farmers.

There are 3 lessons we can learn from the successes of Agricultural Extension Services:

<strong>1) Scale</strong>
Agricultural Extension Services operated on a scale that's hard to fathom today. Extension services placed at least one staff member in virtually every county in the US. That meant that they could reach farmers where they were, year-round. They often help their communities create clubs and a whole range of social groups, gatherings, etc. that provided multiple opportunities for men, women, and children to learn about the latest agricultural tech in a safe environment, surrounded by their friends. If you had questions, it was easy to get answers -- and good extension services staff made sure to build relationships throughout the community so asking questions wasn't intimidating. Given that robotics, AI, augmented and virtual reality, digital fabrication, etc. are going to become as central to our economy as agriculture was in the past, there's no reason we couldn't provide support on a similar scale.

<strong>2) Bottom up Feedback Loops</strong>
Extension Services staff spent a lot of time thinking about how to break down the latest research in the fields of biology, chemistry, soil science, etc. so it was accessible to farmers who usually had at best a high school education. But they also served as a feedback loop. Agriculture experimental stations wouldn't do much good if they didn't understand the problems farmers were currently facing. Extension services staff played a critical role in getting that information and understanding research stations and colleges and helping ensure it would shape the next round of research.

<strong>3) Fostering Civic Engagement</strong>
Finally, many Extension Service agents used their work to push for an approach that went beyond just training farmers in technical skills. They understood that for farming to thrive, conversations couldn't stop at the right technique for planting seeds; they needed to include civic problems such as soil erosion and the structure of commodity prices.

Take the example of Louisiana State University's Mary Mims, who I discussed in a <a href="/2017/06/28/mary-mims-and-the-radical-side-of-agrculture-extension-services/">previous post</a>. Mims, who had a national reputation of one of the best speakers of our era, advocated for a vision of what she called the "community organizing method," which scholar and organizer Harry C Boyte argues was grounded in building community power.

<blockquote>
  Mims, like others in cooperative extension (home economics, 4-H and other areas) drew on the Jane Addams Hull House tradition. She was also inspired by folk schools in Denmark. These had a focus on agency, building the civic power of students, families, and larger communities. They were "schools for life," grounded in the experiences and life of common people not elites, with parallels to the "New School" (Escuela Nueva) movement in Latin America, begun in Columbia, which we've discussed before....
  
  In Mims view, professionals of any kind should be a  "leaven" for community self-organization. "So-called 'social workers' cannot hammer a community into shape," she argued in her book, The Awakening Community. "If a community grows, it must do so from the inside."
</blockquote>

And Mims wasn't alone.  Boyte <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/Bridging-Differences/2017/04/who_makes_change.html">notes</a> that

<blockquote>
  In the US, the United States Department of Agriculture and land grant colleges from 1937 to 1942 involved more than three million people in rural America in community discussions about the future of rural life, taking up issues that ranged from commodity prices and soil erosion to the future of democracy in America.
</blockquote>

Agricultural Extension Services had plenty of problems, and there's now extensive research on the ways in which they often helped reproduce racial, gender, and other inequalities. But there are still a lot of valuable lessons to be learned. If we could bring about these kind of remarkable, far thinking changes in late 19th-century and early 20th century agriculture, there's no reason we can't do the same for robots and other emerging technology today.		]]></content:encoded>

				If we want to create a world in which in every community as many people as possible can participate in creating robotics, AI, virtual and augmented reality, etc., we're going to have to "disrupt" the world of programming languages so coding is easier for adults. As part of a pilot project to try to do that -- <a href="https://makersall.org/mixedreality4all/">Mixed Reality for All</a> -- I've started reading research on "evidence-based" programming language design. I'm just getting started, but so far much of the research reminds me of a story my grandfather Sandy used to tell.

In the 1950s, Sandy spent some time designing rat mazes for some university psychologists. The rats they used were carefully controlled; you literally ordered them out of a catalog based on the characteristics you wanted. One day, the lab techs put a new batch of rats in a rat maze, went away for a bit, then came back to see how the rats were progressing. They couldn't find them. After a little investigation, they figured out what had happened. They'd accidentally been sent a batch of wild rats. Rather than running the maze like genetically bred docile rats did, the wild rats had found a place in the maze that provided some visual cover, chewed a hole in the floor of the maze, and escaped!

Sandy's point was that the psychologists' work on "intelligence" assumed that they were working with animals that weren't that intelligent. If you worked with truly intelligent animals who had to cope with the complexities of the real world, it was hard to get them to focus on the very small corner of intelligence that you want to study. Like a prisoner of war, the first duty of a wild animal being held in a lab is to escape.

A lot of the research on the best way to design a programming language seems to be like it falls into the same trap: it focuses on one small corner of design while not paying enough attention to the larger context.

For example, there's a programming language called Quorum that was designed from the ground up to be driven by the best evidence we have about what makes a good programming language. Their website has a great page that <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/evidence.html">summarizes a lot of the best evidence</a>. The first example: whether programming languages should be statically or dynamically typed (WARNING: this is pretty geeky).

Some programming languages, such as Java, use "static typing": whenever you are going to store info in a variable, you have to tell the computer what type of data you're going to put in that variable.

[code lang=text]
firstName: String;
firstName = &quot;Beyoncé&quot;;
numberOfAlbums: Int;
numberOfAlbums = 6;

print firstName + &quot; has sold &quot; + string(numberOfAlbums) + &quot; albums&quot;;
[/code]

Other programming languages, such as Python, use what's called "dynamic typing," where one of the advantages is that you don't have to spell out what type of data you're using, the computer figures it out:

[code lang=text]
firstName = &quot;Beyoncé&quot;
numberOfAlbums = 6

print firstName + &quot; has sold &quot; + numberOfAlbums + &quot; albums&quot;
[/code]

There are pros and cons for each approach, and more than a few coders like to trash each other for their opinions about it. Guess what, say the evidence-based coding language researchers. We don't need no stinkin' opinions, we've got data: beginners make a lot fewer mistakes with static typing. Game over!

I read one of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5VfKG1fVepaTG41MlNTdWRQSDg/view">papers</a> making that case. It was a smart paper. Essentially what they showed was that if you give programmers one of 2 options:

[code lang=text]
function taskCollision(player: User, opponent: Enemy, engine: GameEngine) // Static Typing
function taskCollision(player, opponent, engine)             // Dynamic Typing
[/code]

More programmers make fewer mistakes with the statically typed code.

Makes sense to me. In their example, static typing gives me more info about what's going on, so I'm less likely to get stuck.

But in the real world, it's not so cut and dried.

Take one of my favorite new editors for writing code: Visual Studio Code. One of the things I like about it is that you can customize it, including adding new features. To do so, you use Type Script, a version of JavaScript that has Static Typing. In theory, Static Typing should give me a more info. But in practice? Here's some sample code from one of their <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/example-word-count">tutorials</a>:

[code lang=text]
export function activate(context: ExtensionContext) {

...

}
...

class WordCounterController {
private _wordCounter: WordCounter;
private _disposable: Disposable;
constructor(wordCounter: WordCounter) {
this._wordCounter = wordCounter;

// subscribe to selection change and editor activation events
let subscriptions: Disposable[] = [];
[/code]

When you first see this code, it looks like gibberish. The fact that the static typing tells you one variable is an ExtensionContext and another one is a Disposable doesn't help much.

In my experience, many systems that use static typing have the same problem: it takes a lot of lines of code to do just about anything, and a lot of the "types" have strange names. It's almost as if languages that use static typing also tend to encourage coders to be more verbose and use (somewhat) geekier names. In contrast, one of the reasons I like working in the programming language Python, which is dynamically typed, is that it encourages people to write code that's more concise and more intelligible (although you can create a hot mess in any language).

An experiment in a lab can tell you that in isolation, one feature/strategy is more effective than another. But that's not all that useful. What you really need is data that tells you what's most effective when you're dealing with all the complexities and interdependencies of code out in the world.

And that brings me to the programming language Quorum, whose website has the synopsis of evidence-based programming design. If it's the most "evidence-oriented" programming language around, it must be pretty hot stuff, right? But from what I can tell from googling and from checking out the rest of their website, nobody seems to be using it for solving real world problems.

Don't get me wrong. A lot of great work was put into it, and some of the tutorials, including how to create a <a href="https://quorumlanguage.com/lessons/chapter4/assignment4_1.html">Frogger-like game</a>, are fun and show a lot of thought (although it requires way too many lines of code). But as far as I can tell, the only people who are seriously into Quorum are high school teachers.

If your only goal is to make it easier to teach kids the basic principles of programming, that's fine. But if you read most of the articles about evidence-based programming design, they're hunting bigger game. There's definitely an undertone to a fair number of evidence-based articles that most people who design coding languages don't have their act together. What's wrong with these jokers that they aren't bothering to look at all this great research?

To which I'd reply: if Quorum is so awesome, why isn't anyone using it for real work? Most of the best coders I've known love learning new programming languages. Many believe if you want to be at the top of your game you should learn a new language every couple of years, if only so you can pick up on some of the latest design concepts that went into them. If anything, these folks can go overboard, forever searching for the Holy Grail of coding languages. If Quorum was all that, at least some of those really skilled folks would be using it and evangelizing for it. But the data is pretty clear: for all its prowess in the lab, Quorum doesn't seem to have gained traction in the real world.

I'm not saying we shouldn't pay attention to research on programming design, some of which is quite thought-provoking. But after my first pass through the literature, it feels like they need to seriously up their game. They need, in short, to start learning from the "wild rats" of coding.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In 2018, Let’s Stop Debating If Robots Will Take Our Jobs</title>

				Here's my New Year's Resolution for all of us: let's stop arguing whether robots/AI will take our jobs.

It's not that the answer doesn't matter -- it's absolutely critical. But short of asking a Terminator that comes back in time, we have no way to what the answer's going to be. It doesn't matter how many Smart Girls &amp; Boys crank out fancy reports filled with numbers they painstakingly crunched. There are just too many unknowns.

What convinced me that this argument is a waste of time were the extraordinary victories this year by <a href="/2017/10/19/with-no-more-human-opponents-alphago-kicks-its-own-ass/">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="/2017/10/23/its-not-just-go-openais-ai-competes-against-top-dota2-gamers/">Open AI</a>. Four years ago, if you'd told me that an AI could teach itself to play Go -- which computers weren't suppose to master for at least a decade -- better than almost all human players in just 3 days, I'd have thought you'd been smoking something. I'm not saying AI is going to advance much faster than expected. But there's simply no way to know.

Does that mean we should stop worrying? Not at all. Regardless of whether robots/AI create mass unemployment, they are going to have a deep, profound impact on the economy -- and create a future that either benefits everyone or mostly those at the top. We could easily end up with plenty of jobs that pay terribly &amp; that lay the groundwork for someone much scarier than Trump. And from Harlem to Harlan County, from East LA to the midWest Rust Belt we need to take advantage of these massive technological changes to make whole these communities that our society abandoned.

In short, in 2018 let's stop obsessing over predicting the future and start obsessing on how to create a more just, prosperous economy for all regardless of how many jobs robots/AI destroy.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>If Robots Don&#039;t Cause Mass Unemployment, Will Many Remaining Jobs Pay $2/Hr?</title>

				Maybe we'll get lucky, and robots/AI won't create mass unemployment.  But of the remaining jobs, how many will be good jobs?  A <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05796.pdf">recent study</a> of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, "one of the largest micro-crowdsourcing markets that is widely used by industry," raises a red flag.

The research found that on average requesters paid $11/hr.  But when you factor in the considerable time workers spend on unpaid labor such as searching for tasks, the actual median wage drops to just $2/hr.  Of the sample of work they analyzed, only 4% earned more than $7.25/hr.

According to researchers Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri, who last year worked with Pew on a <a href="http://www.inthecrowd.org/2016/11/17/spike-in-online-gig-work-flash-in-the-pan-or-future-of-employment/">fascinating study</a> of "on-demand work," this type of work is going to play an increasingly important role in the US economy:

<blockquote>
  Labor economists Lawrence Katz and Al Krueger estimate that conventional temp and alternative contract-driven work rose from 10 to 16%, accounting for all net employment growth in the US economy in the past decade. Assuming Pew’s trends continue at the current rate, by the year 2027, nearly 1 in 3 American adults will transition to online platforms to support themselves with on-demand gig work.
</blockquote>

This is the other reason why we should <a href="/2017/12/21/in-2018-lets-stop-debating-if-robots-will-take-our-jobs/">stop debating whether robots will destroy more jobs than they create</a>.  Even if they don't, we could still end up living in a dystopian future.  It's time to stop obsessing over questions we can't answer and start obsessing over how to build a future that's worth living in.		]]></content:encoded>

				The New York Times rang in the new year with an <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/31/technology/google-images-voters.html">article</a> about Stanford researcher Timnit Gebru, whose team "analyzed 50 million images and location data from Google Street View" and crunched out a number of interesting observations that previous image analysis couldn't manage. As you'd expect, project used some heavy duty AI. But human labor was also critical to their success:

<blockquote>
  But first, a database curated by humans had to train the A.I. software to understand the images.
  
  The researchers recruited hundreds of people to pick out and classify cars in a sample of millions of pictures. Some of the online contractors did simple tasks like identifying the cars in images. Others were car experts who knew nuances like the subtle difference in the taillights on the 2007 and 2008 Honda Accords.
  
  “Collecting and labeling a large data set is the most painful thing you can do in our field,” said Ms. Gebru, who received her Ph.D. from Stanford in September and now works for Microsoft Research.
  
  But without experiencing that data-wrangling work, she added, “you don’t understand what is impeding progress in A.I. in the real world.”
  
  Once the car-image engine was built, its speed and predictive accuracy was impressive. It successfully classified the cars in the 50 million images in two weeks. That task would take a human expert, spending 10 seconds per image, more than 15 years.

According to researchers <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-humans-working-behind-the-ai-curtain">Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri</a>, this low-paid human labor is the dirty little secret fueling the AI revolution: the "paradox of automation’s last mile."

<blockquote>
  Whether it is Facebook’s trending topics; Amazon’s delivery of Prime orders via Alexa; or the many instant responses of bots we now receive in response to consumer activity or complaint, tasks advertised as AI-driven involve humans, working at computer screens, paid to respond to queries and requests sent to them through application programming interfaces (APIs) of crowdwork systems. The truth is, AI is as “fully-automated” as the Great and Powerful Oz was in that famous scene from the classic film, where Dorothy and friends realize that the great wizard is simply a man manically pulling levers from behind a curtain. This blend of AI and humans, who follow through when the AI falls short, isn’t going away anytime soon. Indeed, the creation of human tasks in the wake of technological advancement has been a part of automation’s history since the invention of the machine lathe.
  
  We call this ever-moving frontier of AI’s development, the paradox of automation’s last mile: as AI makes progress, it also results in the rapid creation and destruction of temporary labor markets for new types of humans-in-the-loop tasks. By 2033, economists predict that tech innovation could convert 30% of today’s full-time occupations into augmented services completed “on demand” through a mix of automation and human labor. In short, AI will eliminate some work as it opens up opportunities for redefining what work humans do best. These AI-assisted augmented services, delivered by people quietly working in concert with bots, are poised to enhance our daily productivity but they also introduce new social challenges.
</blockquote>

So it may well be that robots/AI don't end up creating mass unemployment. But that doesn't mean we won't end up in a dystopian future, where many people are trapped in <a href="/2017/12/26/if-robots-dont-cause-mass-unemployment-will-many-remaining-jobs-pay-2-hr/">very low wage jobs</a> that help propel AI/robotics to new heights, creating vast amounts of wealth for the 1%.

If we don't want to end up in a dystopian future, let's make 2018 the year we stop fighting over what robots/AI will do to jobs and <a href="/ma-framework/">start fighting for a better future for all</a>.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Patreon Stats Show We’re a Long, Long Way From &quot;YouTube Done Right”</title>

				The Makers All <a href="/ma-framework/">framework</a> argues we need to build grassroots power at the heart of the economy

<blockquote>
  to ensure that everyone, not just a handful of corporations and the wealthy, gets a seat at the table where decisions get made about the legal and de facto rules governing creative works so that both the creative bounty and the profits are widely shared (e.g., “YouTube Done Right”)
</blockquote>

Just how far are we from that goal? Here are some sobering <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/01/02/patreon-content-creators-monthly-minimum-wage/">stats</a> about the popular site Patreon.

<blockquote>
  Founded by musician (and former YouTuber) Jack Conte in 2013, the service reached 50,000 monthly active content creators last year. With the support of one million monthly active patrons, the company estimated that creators would earn $150 million last year.
</blockquote>

But how many of these creators are really benefiting?

<blockquote>
  Graphtreon.com has graphed all active Patreon campaigns since March 2015. According to the website, the platform now has 79,420 creators. Yet, only 1,393 creators (under 2%) earned the federal monthly minimum wage of $1,160 a month in October 2017. Even worse, if changed to $15 per hour, only 0.8%, or 635 creators, made that amount.
  
  In addition, Graphtreon found that the vast majority on the platform earned between $1 and $100 a month.
</blockquote>

It wouldn’t be surprising if a good chunk of the 50,000 monthly active content creators didn’t earn much money; many might just be dipping their toe in the water. Even so, these numbers are dismal.

The problem isn’t that no one’s making money.

<blockquote>
  Successful Patreon creators on the channel earn up to five-digit incomes per month.
</blockquote>

But the distribution is skewed heavily towards the top.

And that’s the point the Makers All framework is arguing: if we want to have an economy where many people can make much or all of their living from digital creative works, increasing the number of people with the skills to make these creative works is only part of the story. We’ll need to change the rules of the digital road, and that’s going to require large scale community organizing to build grassroots power.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>If You Can Turn It Into A Video Game, AI Can Master It</title>

				https://thumbs.gfycat.com/GregariousScientificApatosaur-max-1mb.gif

Not long ago the idea that a computer could kick butt playing old school video games seemed like sci fi. In the last few years, it was possible. New techniques knocked the learning time from months to 10 hours. Now researchers have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02852">shown</a> that if you throw enough computer chips -- 768 CPU cores -- at the problem, it can crack it in 21 minutes.

AI researchers are <a href="/2017/10/23/its-not-just-go-openais-ai-competes-against-top-dota2-gamers/">still working</a> on building AI that can handle modern, complex multiplayer games, but at this point that looks like it'll take years, not decades. And what that means is that if you can create a "good enough" simulation of a task as a game, AI can master it -- and at the rate we're going, AI will be able to master it faster than a human could learn the task let alone get good at it.

Today, we can't simulate many tasks accurately enough in a game for this technique to pose a threat. But then again, we havent had tons of researchers and incredibly wealthy companies trying to. Similalry, there's also a big difference between an AI in a virtual world and a robot doing the task for real in the physical world, but how much this difference will make as we get better and better at building "good enough" simulations isn't clear.

There are two important lessons from this research.  First, anybody who says they're sure robots/AI aren't a threat to jobs is kidding themselves.

For example, if AI today can -- after we've spent the time to create a "good enough" simlation -- master one type of new skills in 21 minutes, the argument that lots of new jobs will be created to replace the eliminated ones is a lot less reasuring. The reason why that was true in the past was that it took at least a decade if not much longer for new jobs to get automated. Who knows if that will still be true?

All of which is yet another reason to stop obsessing over trying to predict the future and start obsessing over building a more just economy regardless of how many jobs get eliminated.

Second, in robots/AI, size matters -- and that's a real concern for anyone who cares about equality of opportunity. Right now, we've got two types of remarkably effective ML/AI technqiues:

<ul>
<li>Those that require massive datasets</li>
<li>Those that require massive computing firepower</li>
</ul>

What an individual or a small team can accomplish today is pretty impressive -- check out <a href="http://www.fast.ai">Fast.AI</a>'s classes for examples. But for every new trick small fry have at their disposal, the big players have a lot more tricks at their fingertips. And there's no sign this disparity is likely to change in the future.

That's why thinking about and organizing for an economy that works for everyone is so critical -- even if robots/AI don't create mass unemployment, this tech could end up creating even greater disparities in wealth that could destroy our society.		]]></content:encoded>

				I haven't blogged much recently because I've been busy with prep for the kickoff of Makers All's first project, <a href="https://mr4all.org/strategy">Mixed Reality for All</a>. The kickoff went really well, and over the next few weeks it'll be eating up most of my time until things settle into place. I'm hoping by then end of this week I'll get back to writing a weekly substantive blog post; you can also catch me on Twitter at <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/raschneiderman">@raschneiderman</a>.

 And if you're in the D.C. area and you're interested in getting involved, please join our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Mixed-Reality-For-All-DC-Tech-Team/">Mixed Reality for All DC Tech Team Meetup</a>. Should be a lot of fun! 		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>McKinsey: Buckle Up for a Whole Lotta Retraining!</title>

				McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/future-of-organizations-and-work/retraining-and-reskilling-workers-in-the-age-of-automation">says</a> we don't need to worry that AI, robots etc will create mass unemployment -- there will be plenty of new work. The catch: not enough people will know how to do it.

<blockquote>
  By 2030, according to the a recent McKinsey Global Institute report, Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation, as many as 375 million workers—or roughly 14 percent of the global workforce—may need to switch occupational categories as digitization, automation, and advances in artificial intelligence disrupt the world of work. The kinds of skills companies require will shift, with profound implications for the career paths individuals will need to pursue.
</blockquote>

How big of a disruption are we talking here?

<blockquote>
  it’s akin to coping with the large-scale shift from agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred in the early 20th century in North America and Europe.... Those earlier workforce transformations took place over many decades, allowing older workers to retire and new entrants to the workforce to transition to the growing industries. But the speed of change today is potentially faster. The task confronting every economy, particularly advanced economies, will likely be to retrain and redeploy tens of millions of midcareer, middle-age workers. As the MGI report notes, “there are few precedents in which societies have successfully retrained such large numbers of people.”
</blockquote>

And that was just one transition. As AI and robots keep getting better, even if there are enough new jobs to be had, it's quite possible millions will go throgh this trauma over and over -- assuming, of course, that this unprecedentedly massive retraining efforts can pull it off the first time.

Who's going to pull off this moumental task? According to CEOs, not the government.

<blockquote>
  While they clearly do not expect to solve this alone—forging creative partnerships with a wide range of relevant players, for example, will be critical—by a nearly a 5:1 margin, the executives in our latest survey believe that corporations, not governments, educators, or individual workers, should take the lead in trying to close the looming skills gap. That’s the view of 64 percent of the private-sector executives in the United States who see this as a top-ten priority issue, and 59 percent in Europe.
</blockquote>

But are they begnning to take actions anywhere near the scale needed to back up their beliefs? Not that I've seen. And they don't think so either; only 16% said they felt very prepared to kick into gear.

Not to worry, says McKinsey.

<blockquote>
  But for now, we simply take comfort from the clear message of our latest survey: among large companies, senior executives see an urgent need to rethink and retool their role in helping workers develop the right skills for a rapidly changing economy—and their will to meet this challenge is strong. That’s not a bad place to start.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				In the last few weeks, there have been a slew of pieces on robots, AI, and the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/what-does-a-future-with-no-jobs-look-like-71bda1004a71">future of work</a>.  What they all have in common:  when talking about problems they talk about inequality, but when they talk about solutions they seem incapable of talking seriously about power.  I'm too wiped out from a death in my extended family to do a deeper dive today; more on this next week.  But for now, <a href="http://www.blackpast.org/1857-frederick-douglass-if-there-no-struggle-there-no-progress">Fredrick Douglass</a>' got it covered:

<blockquote>
  Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters....
  
  Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.

		<title>What Can Excel Teach Us About Smoothing the Learning Curve?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				In most organizations  with a good-sized IT department, one of the banes of their existence is Microsoft Excel. Ironically, this is even more of a problem in the age of analytics, Data Science, etc. The IT staff and their consultants spend a lot of time lovingly crafting solutions so that with a touch of a button, users can produce gorgeous, powerful analyses. And yet IT still has to contend with users who squirrel away nuggets of data in ratty old Excel spreadsheets.

It often drives IT staff like me nuts, because these spreadsheets are often built on data from God knows where and that aren't connected to the main data systems. So those spreadsheets end up producing numbers that don't jive with other departments' numbers -- and guess who has to waste far too much of their time figuring out why? Hint: it's not the person who created the Excel spreadsheet. But despite IT's best efforts, they can never get rid of all of those ratty old Excel spreadsheets.

There's a good reason for that. Those shiny, click-a-button solutions? They're both powerful and easy to use -- but only so long as users stick to the well-marked trails these solutions were designed to support. If you want to go where the trails were designed to take you, you're all set. But if you need to step off those trails even just a bit, it's like falling off a cliff. If you can't solve the problem clicking a few buttons, you need to be a full-blown, skilled developer to cut your own path.

But with Excel? Excel's motto ought to be, Git 'Er Done. If you know the basics of Excel and you're a little adventurous, it's amazing what you can get it to do with a little help from Ms. Google. You can start by learning a trick or two, then gradually add more tools to your toolbox of tricks as needed. The results aren't always pretty; sometimes it feels like Excel is duct tape for data. But like duct tape, you don't need to be incredibly skilled to solve a remarkable range of problems.

And when people who have squirreled away Excel spreadsheets aren't driving me crazy, I have to admit that in the past few years Microsoft has done a terrific job: modern Excel can often easily produce analyses that are gorgeous. In fact, when I need to get something done quick and dirty, even with all the fancy developer data tools I have at my disposal I often reach for Excel. Now that I'm self-employed, for example, I know I should take the time to learn a more sophisticated tool for handling my finances, and my inner data geek hates how sloppily I'm handling my data, but I never get around to it -- it ain't always pretty, but Excel spreadsheets are just so easy to tweak and extend.

If we're going to create an economy where lots of people in every community are able to make a living off of the emerging worlds of robotics, AI, virtual and augmented reality, digital fabrication, wearables, etc., I think Excel has a valuable lesson to teach us. Tools that let us point-and-click to easily do amazing things are great. But we also need to start building our tools so they can do what Excel Excel does so well.

So long as the worlds of point-and-click and serious coding are completely separate, I don't see how emerging tech will ever be truly democratized. And that's nuts, because as Excel has shown, it doesn't have to be that way. If we can create a smooth learning curve between learning how to use the tool, becoming a "power user," and becoming a skilled developer, it won't just make life easier in using the tech. Done properly, it could have a deep and profound impact on how just and equitable we can make our economy.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Model the Blue-Collar Coding Job Ladder After Restaurants, Not Construction Work</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				A few years ago, Anil Dash wrote an influential <a href="http://anildash.com/2012/10/the-blue-collar-coder.html">piece</a> advocating for what he called "blue-collar coding":

<blockquote>
  High schools have long offered vocational education, preparing graduates for practical careers by making them proficient in valuable technical skill sets which they can put to use directly in the job market right after graduation. Vocational-technical schools (vo-tech) provide trained workers in important fields such as healthcare, construction trades, and core business functions like accounting. For a significant number of my high school peers, vo-tech was the best path to a professional job that would pay well over the duration of an entire career. Now it’s time that vo-tech programs broadly add internet and web technologies to the mix. We need web dev vo-tech...
  
  Put another way, our industry can grow in a very meaningful way by giving lots of young people at a high school level the knowledge they need to learn jQuery straight out of high school, or teaching maintenance on a MySQL database at a trade school without having to get a graduate degree in computer science. That’s not to say that CS students aren’t also important — we’ll need the breakthroughs and innovations they discover. But someone has to run that intranet app at an insurance company, and somebody has to maintain the internal iOS app at a law firm, and those are solid, respectable jobs that are as key to our economy as a 22-year-old trying to pivot and iterate their way into an acqu-hire.
</blockquote>

I think this is really smart. The one qualm I've had about this idea is that when people use the phrase "blue-collar coding," there's often an implicit assumption that blue-collar coding jobs would be silo'd off from the highly skilled developers who create the software, frameworks, etc. that everyone else uses. As Dash himself wrote in a more <a href="https://medium.com/humane-tech/its-more-than-just-teach-kids-to-code-177fd6cb7184">recent piece</a>:

<blockquote>
  <strong>Applied CS over theory</strong>: A lot of yesterday’s computer science programs emphasized abstract concepts that could often be hard to translate into practical impact. Given that more students have access to technology in their everyday lives than ever before, recontextualizing CS education to connect directly to the tools and devices they already use can ensure that what we’re teaching is relevant. By analogy, we’re going to need a lot more electricians than electrical engineers, even if we know that the two related disciplines are both important and valuable.
</blockquote>

The problem with this analogy is that nobody expects any electricians to become electrical engineers, just like no one expects some construction workers to become architects.

I think we want to try to build a tech job ladder that's more like the restaurant industry. It's not uncommon for a great, influential chef to have started their career washing dishes or peeling carrots and then worked their way up.

I'm not saying blue-collar coders should aspire to be a tech celebrity chef; people should be able to have a great career that affords them a middle-class life without needing a CS degree. But I do think we should build a pathway that's more fluid and that encourages more mobility.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is Spotify a Harbinger of Our Robot/AI-Dominated Future?</title>

				Spotify is about to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/media/spotify-ipo.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share">go public</a>, and it may be valued at as much as $23 billion.  Its founders are about to become filthy rich.  Record companies won't do too shabby either.

<blockquote>
  The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed.
</blockquote>

And musicians?  Most popular musicians are still making so little from streaming that their main source of income is from touring.

This is why future fights over who has a seat at the table -- and therefore gets to decide how staggering  amounts of wealth are divvied up -- is going to be absolutely critical in the era of ubiquitous robots, AI, and other emerging tech.  There's no question our society is going to end up with an unprecedented bounty.  What's up for grabs:  whether our society will ensure everyone has a real chance at enough of a slice of that bounty to live a good life, and whether our democracy survives.

<hr />

Update:  this piece is <strong>not</strong> an attack on Spotify.  I listen to Spotify almost every day.  And although I'm sure there are problems unique to Spotify, given the current rules of the road almost any music streaming service that became dominant would have most of the same core issues.  This is a structural problem.  If you treat it like the problem is just one "corrupt" company, you are letting yourself be played for a sucker.		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				If someone tells you that AI won’t ever be a threat to us because why would it want to kill us, they really don’t get how brittle and nonlinearly weird this tech can be.  A wonderful <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03453v1">new paper</a> compiles a bunch of examples from AI software that used evolutionary strategies that through trial and error discovered some... unusual solutions.    For example,

<blockquote>
  when MIT Lincoln Labs evaluated GenProg on a buggy sorting program, researchers created tests that measured whether the numbers output by the sorting algorithm were in sorted order. However, rather than actually repairing the program (which sometimes failed to correctly sort), GenProg found an easier solution: it entirely short-circuited the buggy program, having it always return an empty list, exploiting the technicality that an empty list was scored as not being out of order.
</blockquote>

Here’s another example where the AI "solved" a problem that technically fit the rules it was given:

<blockquote>
  In another project, to avoid runaway computation, the fitness function explicitly limited a program’s CPU usage: in response, GenProg produced programs that slept forever, which did not count toward CPU usage limits, since there were no computations actually performed
</blockquote>

We rarely hear about these "solutions" because when AI come up with them, researchers tweak the victory conditions to bar them.  That works just fine in a highly comtrolled, highly simplifted  lab environment.  But as we build more and more systems that are expected to work in ever more complex environments, catching all these novel solutions gets a lot harder.  And if an AI thinks the best way to sort a list is to kill the list...

Does this mean we should be paranoid about AI?  No.  But blithely assuming it’ll never be a threat is equally foolish.  We need to assume that <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Uncle Murphy</a> will be a not infrequent guest of AI systems and act accordingly.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Are Orgs Like Uber Creating a New Workplace or Reviving an Old One?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I’ve been reading about the political economy  of late 19th century US, and a quote from a recent  <a href="https://psmag.com/economics/the-future-of-work-the-coming-political-storms">article</a> by historian Charles Postel caught my eye.

<blockquote>
  The advocates of the new work regime claim that it is paving the way to the “flexible” economy of the future. In the process, it is unleashing the inner entrepreneur of the Walmart “associate” and the Uber “peer.” But for millions of workers the new “flexibility” means little more than overwork and insecurity, and the advertised work regime of the future represents a throwback to the exploitative tyranny of the first machine age.
  
  In the late 19th century, the telegraph, steam engines, and electric power changed everything. But they also changed nothing. Because, as before, most work involved long hours at low pay in domestic service, farm labor, construction, mining, and other strenuous jobs. Hiring was often day-by-day, and many workers operated as semi-independent contractors. The infamous “sweating system” meant families set their own hours, their own pace, in their own living spaces (tenements). Coal miners, too, often worked as their own bosses, getting paid by the ton. This “flexible” work regime translated into hazardous work, child labor, and physical and mental torment. Workers stood one accident or bout of unemployment or sickness from catastrophe.
</blockquote>

Uber may be using an app to manage the people who do its work but the  people infrastructure "stack" the app sits on is right out of the 1880s.

The tech world is skilled at making us believe that everything it’s selling is new.  And because change is occurring at a blistering pace, it’s easy to assume that when we compare the present to the past it is "disrupting," the only history we need to consider is the history of Right Before Now.  It’s not.

The work arrangements of Right Before Now, where many people had one employer who provided steady employment and benefits, wasn’t natural or inevitable.  People fought and bled to create it, to "disrupt" the previous people infrastructure stack so children could have a childhood and an unprecedented number of working families could benefit from the prosperity they helped create.

In short,  let’s not get suckered by companies like Uber.  Let’s stop talking about "disrupting" and start talking about what values we want the new world of work to uphold.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Licking My Wounds: Had to Shut Down Mixed Reality for All</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				About two weeks ago, I came to a very painful decision:  I had to shut down the Mixed Reality for All project.  I really, really didn’t want to do it.  But to run a tricky project like, you need to be able to put in a lot more face time than I’d anticipated.  It’s been almost seven years since I messed up my knees, and I thought I was finally at the point where I could sit as well as stand for long enough to be able to pull off an organizing project.  That turned out not to be the case.

There’s a lot you can do remotely, through video chat, etc., but there are real limits.  For example, if you’re trying to convince partners who aren’t sure what you’re proposing is feasible, you can do a lot online, but at the end of the day there’s no substitute for spending time face to face — especially for building the bonds of trust needed to be folks to take a leap of faith.  Maybe a better organizer than I am could’ve figured out how; I couldn’t.

I’m still reeling from the decision.  I got to work with some fabulous people, and the online community around A-Frame is just wonderful.  And it’s hard in a situation like this not to feel like I’m letting some people down.  But I’ve been running projects for long enough to know when it’s time to face reality and pull the plug.

That said, I learned a lot from working on Mixed Reality for All.  In the next few weeks I hope to blog about some of the lessons I learned.  But for now, it’s time to lick my wounds and decompress.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Mixed Reality for All Strategy</title>

				Since I’m shutting down the Mixed Reality for All website, I want to preserve the final write up of the project’s strategy; here is is.

<hr />

<h2>The Opportunity</h2>

Cutting edge tech often takes a long time to reach low-income and marginalized communities. Hard-working community groups struggle to train a handful of people so that a trickle of the billions of dollars generated by this new tech reaches their community.  But what if instead of being relegated to the back of the bus, these communities grabbed a seat at the front?

We believe there's an opportunity to do this in the emerging fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and others are engaged in a fierce battle over which handful of players will dominate this new industry. If community groups work together, they can leverage this battle to ensure their communities can help shape the course of this new industry. In doing so they can:

<ul>
<li>Create jobs, co-ops, small businesses, etc. and obtain a seat at the table so their communities benefit economically</li>
<li>Create a model for communities to ensure all other emerging technologies benefit them economically -- especially as robots/AI begin automating away other jobs</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Key: Make AR/VR Development More Accessible to All</h2>

For the tech companies competing over AR/VR, accessibility is a key strategic advantage. If we can make it much easier for regular people from South Central to Harlan County to develop AR/VR projects, it'll also be easier for corporate developers, "power users," and other staff to do so. Here's how we'll do it:

<ul>
<li><strong>Smooth The Learning Curve</strong>. Most new tech makes it easy to do a handful of tasks. But as soon as users need to go beyond the point-and-click basics, they hit a dauntingly steep learning curve. So, use user experience design (UX) to figure out how to redesign AR/VR development tools and frameworks to smooth out the learning curve from absolute beginner to seasoned pro. In doing so, ensure that over time more and more people in the community learn not only how to use existing tools and but how to create new ones -- and in doing shape the industry's direction.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Community-Oriented Approach</strong>.  One-time trainings are a good place to start, but to gain fluency most people need ongoing technical and psychological support. So, develop an ecosystem of support, including strategies to plug into social institutions people already belong to.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Build a Model</strong>:  use our experience with AR/VR development to create a model for changing the culture of emerging tech.  The goal: all emerging tech is designed from the ground up so it's easy for people in every community to get started and easy for them to "level up" their skills as needed. This model will also open up the debate over what it means to "democratize" technology.

<h2>Initial Partners</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Community Groups</strong>: members of marginalized/low income community groups, whose voice and needs will drive the project. Their goal: to create jobs and business/co-op opportunities in their communities, building ownership and ensuring they control a seat at the emerging tech table.  </li>
<li><p><strong>Tech Community</strong>: a diverse group of tech designers, coders, and AR/VR experts who care passionately about working collaboratively with low-income communities and creating a diverse tech community. Their goal: help the community while learning new skills and building their resume</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tech Players</strong>: a few individuals from the main AR/VR players, to provide informal technical support/expertise and to begin a dialogue about what it means to "democratize" their technology.  Their goal: to make their tech more accessible and help their company win a piece of the AR/VR pie.</p></li>
</ul>		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I think we can now confidently say we’re now at the point where Big Tech needs to be seriously regulated.  Facebook is in the hot seat right today, but as  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/business/media/amazon-google-privacy-digital-assistants.html">New York Times</a>  research into Amazon and Google patents show,  there’s plenty more to be nervous about.

A scene from a future Amazon hopes to bring about, as described in a November <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=amazon.AANM.&amp;s2=conversational&amp;OS=AANM/amazon+AND+conversational&amp;RS=AANM/amazon+AND+conversational">patent</a>:

You’re taking to a friend on the phone or "within a detectable distance of [a] device” like Alexa.  You <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?docid=20170323645&amp;PageNum=4&amp;IDKey=14B897CFB3C3&amp;HomeUrl=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r=1%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526co1=AND%2526d=PG01%2526s1=amazon.AANM.%2526s2=conversational%2526OS=AANM/amazon%252BAND%252Bconversational%2526RS=AANM/amazon%252BAND%252Bconversational">say</a>

<blockquote>
  The vacation was wonderful.  I really enjoyed Orange County and the beaches.  And the kids loved the San Diego zoo.
</blockquote>

The device is running a “sniffer algorithm" that’s looking for "trigger words,"  "often a verb indicating some level of desire or interest" such as like, love, enjoy, downloaded, hate, returned.

<blockquote>
  For each identified potential trigger word, the device can capture adjacent audio that can be analyzed, on the device or remotely, to attempt to determine one or more keywords associated with that trigger word.
</blockquote>

So when you said “loves,” it triggers the device to analyze your conversation and extract the words “San Diego zoo.”  It’d does the same thing for your friend, who replied,

<blockquote>
  When we went to Southern California, I fell in love with Santa Barbara.  There were so many great wineries to visit.
</blockquote>

So at the end of the call, your device could send you a discount for a San Diego season zoo pass and her a wine of the month discount.  And all of the info about these keywords, including the context of the call, could be stored as part of a profile of you and your friend.

Google’s even more ambitious.  They don’t just want to extract info from every conversation you have, they want every drop of info they can get.  In their <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=3&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=Google.AANM.&amp;s2=mischief&amp;OS=AANM/Google+AND+mischief&amp;RS=AANM/Google+AND+mischief">September 2016 patent</a> about a home monitoring system, they envision the following, either in a homeowner’s—  or renter’s— home could be closely monitored.  According to the patent,

<blockquote>
  an audio signature matching a dining chair movement across a floor may suggest that an occupant is sitting in the chair (e.g., because the occupant may have presumably moved the chair  to sit in it). Indeed, video inputs may confirm and/or identify that occupants are sitting in the chair  and/or at the table. Additionally, smart device  inputs may be used to obtain a number of contextual clues, such as utensil movement, conversation content, vapor detection, etc. For example, in one embodiment, the vapor sensors may detect the presence of food within the dining room zone, which may indicate that a meal is being consumed in the dining room.....      an audio signature of keyboard clicking, a desk chair moving, and/or papers shuffling etc. may indicate that someone is working.... an audio signature and/or video signature may be associated with the sounds and/or images of teeth brushing in the zone 618. Next, additional characteristics may be determined (e.g., the sink  being left on, a duration of teeth brushing, a speed of teeth brushing, etc.).  These findings may me reported and/or recorded within the system (e.g., for subsequent control and/or reporting by the household policy manager [program ]) .
</blockquote>

And all of this info could be sliced and diced by demographic info.

<blockquote>
  Demographic information may include, for example: occupant information such as: number of occupants, gender of occupants, age of occupants, ethnicity of occupants.
</blockquote>

And the techniques for gathering this data could be pretty sophisticated.

<blockquote>
  By way of example, a video monitoring camera placed in the kitchen of the home can perform image processing on several days or weeks worth of captured data to determine how many different individuals it sees on a regular basis, to establish how many occupants live in the house.
</blockquote>

What could be done with all this data?  Well, the patent suggests, you could use it to identify children’s behavior.

<blockquote>
  For example, characteristics of audio signatures, such as speech patterns, pitch, etc. may be used to discern child occupancy. Next, the occupants may be monitored, specifically listening for low-level audio signatures (e.g., whispering or silence), while the occupants are active (e.g., moving or performing other actions).  Based upon the detection of these low-level audio signatures combined with active monitored occupants, the system may infer that mischief (e.g., activities that should not be occurring) is occurring.....   For example, it may be expected that certain activities be performed in quiet, thus indicating that the quiet activity is unlikely to be mischief. For example, reading a book, mediating, etc. are oftentimes performed in quiet.....
  
  
  
  For example, audio monitoring, optical monitoring, infrared monitoring, etc. may be used to discern occupancy and undesirable activities of the occupants. In one embodiment, the contextual data may include audio signatures indicating "bully" keywords such as derogatory name-calling, elevated voices, etc. Accordingly, the system may monitor for and detect the use of such "bully" keywords.  Additionally, in some embodiments, the contextual data may include audio signatures indicating the use of foul language.
</blockquote>

And not just kids.

<blockquote>
  returning to the "I'll be home by 5:00" assertion, the system may determine a current location of the household member and how long it would take to get from the current location to the occupant's house (block 394 of FIG. 46). If the occupant's house can be reached by 5:00, a determination is made as to whether the assertion/promise has been met (decision block 356 of FIG. 45 and decision block 400 of FIG. 46).... If the assertion has been met, routine monitoring proceeds (block 358 of FIG. 45 and block 402 of FIG. 46)....  If the assertion/promise cannot be met (e.g., the occupant's house cannot be reached by 5:00), a finding that the assertion cannot be met may be reported and/or recorded (block 360 of FIG. 45 and block 398 of FIG. 46).
</blockquote>

What an abusive spouse — or an authoritarian regime — could do with this kind of automated micro surveillance is not a topic covered by the patent.

The system could also be used to monitor group behavior:

<blockquote>
  For example, if the household indicated a goal to spend more time doing activities together and the system monitoring indicates that the household is spending less time together or marginally more time together, the system may provide a reminder of the household goal to one or more members of the household (e.g., via an audible and/or visual alert in the household, via a text message provided to the user's smartphone, etc.)....  If sufficient progress toward the goal is attained, a progress reward may be provided to one or more members of the household. For example, in the togetherness goal mentioned above, if the family spends 20 additional minutes together in a week, when the goal is to spend an additional hour together a week, a progress reward may be provided to the family.
</blockquote>

And you could use it to see if you’re keeping up with the Joneses.

<blockquote>
  In one embodiment, household bragging rights may be a reward, by providing a neighborhood message to other participating households, stating that the household is progressing towards and/or has attained the particular goal.
</blockquote>

These visions of a world in which Big Tech has the ability  record any scrap of info about us  aren’t from some random  email an idiot marketing manager sent to their boss or videotaped off the cuff remarks at some conference.  At least a few people at Amazon and Google thought they were nifty enough to apply for patents.  That’s not remotely the same as official business plans.  But the fact that there’s a corporate culture at places like Amazon and Google where these public legal documents would be considered OK should give us pause.

There are a lot of great, caring people who work at Big Tech companies who’d be appalled at the iPanOpticon sentiments behind these patents.  But given the resources, power, and reach that Big Tech now has, we need to make damn sure that while they "move fast and break things" they don’t end destroying our liberty and our society’s future.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Writing Our Stories, Writing Code:  A Community-Centered Approach to Teaching Coding</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				<em>While working on the Mixed Reality for All project, I started thinking about how you might teach coding to adults in low income communitities where instead of treating them as isolated individuals, you'd take advantage of the power of community. At one point I wrote a quick-and-dirty sketch of what such a class might look like. It's pretty rough -- for example, I had some ideas about how you could take advantage of existing instituions, such as churches or unions, but didnt have the time to think them through.  But there are enough ideas here that I think it's worth sharing.</em>

Google has a VR development kit called <a href="https://edu.google.com/expeditions/#header">Google Expeditions</a> that lets teachers teach through stories by creating "immersive, virtual journeys" for their students. It's pretty impressive. But when using Google Expeditions, teachers are limited to just the tools that Google decided to put in this toolbox. If teachers need more tools to tell their story, they're out of luck.

What if people in low income communities could create their own stories in VR/AR, and instead of being limited to the tools in the toolbox a big corporation gave them, they could make new tools? Could they unleash their inner Grand Master Flash, who helped create Hip-Hop by morphing a tool for playing music -- a turntable -- into a tool for making music?

Or to put it another way: what if we can interweave the art of creating stories in AR/VR with learning  the craft of how to code?

It might look something like this:

In the first workshop, a group of adults meet for a Friday night and half of a Saturday. On Friday night, first they participate in a <a href="http://workingnarratives.org/article/story-circles/">story circle</a>. Then they learn how to use one simple coding technique to begin the journey of expressing their story in VR. For example, each participant comes up with 3 words that sums up their story. Using a code template that displays one word in VR, they create their first VR page that displays their 3 words (see example at the end). They finish by showing off their VR page and do a brief check-in about how they're feeling about what they've learned so far.

On Saturday, they start adding a few tools to their storytelling toolbox -- e.g., tools for adding a picture, a paragraph of text, some simple interactions and animation -- so they can create the first version of their story. The workshop alternates between a little instruction, a lot of playing and experimenting with code -- possibly working in pairs ala <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming?">pair programming</a> -- and thinking together about storytelling &amp; reflecting on their experience so far. Through play, they practice the same coding techniques over &amp; over so coding starts to feel less scary and more like a means of expressing themselves.

The group meets again for a few shorter Saturday sessions that take place every other week. Each time they learn one or two more coding techniques, a little more about VR/AR design &amp; how to tell a story, plus sharing their stories about the experience. In doing so, they also build the trust &amp; community they need to help them get over any fears (which is at least 50% of the battle).  In between these sessions, they work on their own or with coding buddies on their coding skill and their story -- and each week the main group doesn't meet, there is an optional Saturday drop in session for anyone who needs a little help.

Then they start the 2nd part of the course: learning how to make tools to add to their toolkit. They begin with another Friday night - Saturday half day workshop, then meet every other week for shorter Saturday sessions. Although this part will be harder than Part 1, they will already have a solid grounding in some of the basic skills they need to do this, and they will have enough experience of thinking of coding not as this foreign thing that only super geeks can do but a way of expressing themselves. As a result, rather than each new technique being a chance to feel stupid, it's a chance to expand how they can express themselves. And they will have a community of trust -- a "Band of Brothers and Sisters" -- to help them get through any parts that feel intimidating/scary.

In these sessions, they also begin to discuss what it might mean to make an economy where more and more people could make part of their living by making and sharing tools and other ways of creating value, wealth, ownership, and community in AR/VR. For example, what would it mean to say "we own what we make" in this new economy?

By the end of this part of their journey, those who want to continue should be able to start meeting on their own, getting help through the network they have already learned how to plug into of other folks around the country who've gone through a similar experience and who -- with occasional help from world-class expert techies from around the globe --  have been helping to shape the path people take to keep improving their skills. And perhaps a few of them will learn how to help teach the next set of workshops.

Here's what the augmented reality example above might look like:

<ul>
<li>One word template: <a href="https://aschneiderman.github.io/aframe-explore/basics/one-word.html">view it</a>, see the <a href="https://github.com/aschneiderman/aframe-explore/blob/master/basics/one-word.html">underlying code</a> using an open source Javascript framework called <a href="https://aframe.io/examples/">A-Frame</a></p></li>
<li><p>3 words: <a href="https://aschneiderman.github.io/aframe-explore/basics/anders-three-words.html">view it</a>, see the <a href="https://github.com/aschneiderman/aframe-explore/blob/master/basics/anders-three-words.html">underlying code</a> (to understand why I chose "wild rats", read the beginning of <a href="/2017/12/18/wild-rats-and-evidence-based-programming-language-design-very-geeky/">this post</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although you don't have a virtual reality headset, you can still view and interact with these pages using a desktop web browser-- either Google Chrome or Firefox. To move around, use the arrow keys to move forward and back and your mouse to rotate what you're seeing. You can also view them on a smart phone, although on my iPhone I need to tilt it up before I can see the words.

Many years ago I taught adult education workshops on beginning HTML, and I'm pretty confident that anyone with a high school level literacy could be taught to be comfortable changing the one word template into their own 3 words and to understand what they're doing. The key is a) starting with a group exercise that lets people understand what it means to code (my favorite: "the boss's idiot nephew")  and b) lots &amp; lots of practice with supportive people.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>By 2030, the Global 1% Will Own Two Thirds of All Wealth</title>

				<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/07/global-inequality-tipping-point-2030">According</a> to the Guardian newspaper, we’re likely headed towards an unparalleled concentration of global wealth.

<blockquote>
  An alarming projection produced by the [UK] House of Commons library suggests that if trends seen since the 2008 financial crash were to continue, then the top 1% will hold 64% of the world’s wealth by 2030
</blockquote>

The reason for this disturbing prediction? Wealth was already far too concentrated before the financial crashes of 2008. And since then,

<blockquote>
  the wealth of the richest 1% has been growing at an average of 6% a year – much faster than the 3% growth in wealth of the remaining 99% of the world’s population
</blockquote>

And as far as I can tell, this prediction doesn’t take into account the potential impact of robots/AI, which sure looks like it's going to create massive increases in inequality if we don't change the rules of the road.

If we want our democracy to survive the age of robots/AI, figuring out what to do about jobs isn’t enough; we also have to confront head-on the concentration of wealth.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>To Make Coding Accessible, Fix Frameworks, Not Languages [Geeky]</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I've started reading the research literature on how to make coding more accessible. One thing I've noticed is that almost all of it is focused on fixing programming languages. But given how coding has changed in the last decade or so, I'm wondering if focusing some of their efforts on libraries and/or frameworks would make more sense (WARNING: Very Geeky).

Take data science. Many say that the Python programming language has become increasingly important in data science, but that's not really accurate. When people say "Python," what they really mean are several libraries written in Python: tensorflow or PyTorch for machine learning/AI, pandas for slicing and dicing data, etc. And if you're going to visualize your data in pandas, you need to master one of several Python data visualization libraries. Or you might use d3, a data visualization library written in JavaScript that's responsible for a lot of the gorgeous visualizations you see on major news sites.

Even more importantly, having taken an intro class in Python doesn't really prepare you to work in these libraries. Both pandas and d3 use an approach that's called "functional programming," and as I can attest from teaching them, they both look and feel wildly different than working in vanilla Python/JavaScript.

Similarly, the modern world of JavaScript web and application development -- e.g., Node -- has morphed into something that's unrecognizable to someone who'd learned JavaScript many years ago. Even worse, there's a remarkable amount of churn. If you'd taken the time to learn the Angular application framework a few years ago, by the time you'd really mastered it you'd be under a lot of pressure to switch to newer frameworks such as React or Vue.

And that's a real problem for beginners: they can't do a heck of a lot of useful work unless you've also mastered one or more libraries/frameworks. Let's take one more example. Say you are a beginner who's gotten excited about programming in AR/VR. To do it, you'd have to both learn a language and a framework -- either C# and Unity or JavaScript and A-Frame (my favorite). Based on my limited experience learning/teaching them, wrapping your head around the frameworks, not the underlying language, is the biggest challenge for beginners. And as I've discussed previously, the stumbling blocks a beginner faces working in a framework <a href="/2017/12/18/wild-rats-and-evidence-based-programming-language-design-very-geeky/">may be very different</a> than those for a language.

Finally, libraries/frameworks also offer one big advantage over languages for researchers who are trying to have an impact on the real world: as far as I can tell, most programmers switch libraries/frameworks more frequently than they do languages. Getting an ecosystem of Python coders to switch to a new language designed by researchers to be easier to learn? That's a pretty tall order. Convincing them to switch from one Python data visualization library to another is a much easier sell. And in the JavaScript world? Folks have gotten so used to a ridiculous rate of framework/library churn that if a researcher created a new framework that was substantially easier to use, odds are good that a lot of coders would jump ship.

Obviously there's still plenty of room to do interesting research on making languages easier to learn and use. But if researchers want to have a bigger impact, libraries/frameworks might be a better bet.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Robot/AI Jobs Debate Is Too Cramped</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Using a small army of cheap, recent college graduates; 32 deep learning algorithms; and a Greek Oracle who just escaped from rehab, CrystalBall Associates has produced a forecast of the future they're confident is 97.82% accurate. The good news: robots and AI won't create mass unemployment. Instead, millions of people will have a <a href="/2018/01/01/lousy-jobs-and-the-paradox-of-automations-last-mile/">"Last Mile automation" job</a>, helping with training AI/robot algorithms and making the "edge case" decisions AI doesn't yet know how to do. Their day will sound something like this:
"Yes, that's a pair of black shoes."
"No, you shouldn't have taken that turn."
"Yes, you should give a refund."
"Yes."
"No."
"Yes."
"No."
"I'm not sure, ask my supervisor."
"Yes."
"No."
"No."
"Yes."
Every day. For the rest of their working life.

While doing this mindnumbing, soul sucking work, they will live in a world where they are surrounded by a cornucopia of robots, AI, virtual and augmented reality, digital fabrication, and other dazzling, creative technologies.

Yay?

I spent the last six months immersed in the <a href="/2018/03/21/the-mixed-reality-for-all-strategy/">Mixed Reality for All</a> project. Now that <a href="/2018/03/20/licking-my-wounds-had-to-shut-down-mixed-reality-for-all/">it's over</a> and I'm back to listening to the high-level debate over robots/AI, I'm struck by how cramped this debate feels.

Maybe it's because of the experience I had teaching how to create virtual reality using <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>. I've been teaching coding for many years, and this is the first time I giggled so much while creating lessons. Typically, in the first class you learn how to get the computer to print your name and add two numbers together. With VR programming, you start by learning how to create something out of nothing:  type a line or two of code and suddenly there are brightly colored balls floating around you. For a moment, I got a glimpse of what it could be like to live in a world where instead of playing a wizard, almost anyone could be a wizard.

We are about to have an opportunity that is unique in human history. It hasn't gone unnoticed in the robot/AI debate, but it's an afterthought. In between saying we don't need to worry about jobs and arguing that we need more training opportunities for future "high skill" work and must do something about inequality, someone will toss in a line about how robot/AI will eliminate a lot of drudge work and create more room for creativity. But they never unpack the implications of that throwaway line.

I think it's time we start.		]]></content:encoded>

				I haven't posted anything the last two weeks, and that's because I've been swamped getting a new project off the ground. I'm going to take a number of lessons I learned from the Mixed Reality for All project and turn them into a report on what it will take to make robotics, AIA, mixed reality, and other emerging tech truly accessible to all communities. I'm hoping to finish it by the end of the year. In the meantime, I should be back to regular posting by next week.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Can Babershops Help Save Us From Job-Killing Robots?</title>

				https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/22/upshot/22up-healthbarber/22up-healthbarber-facebookJumbo.jpg

Interesting news from a new study on reducing blood pressure. A few years ago, researchers had trained barbers "to check blood pressure and refer people with high levels to physicians." It only had a small effect, they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800500/">thought</a>, because too often the physicians didn't prescribe blood pressure medication. So this time, researchers tried a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/upshot/what-barbershops-can-teach-about-delivering-health-care.html">different approach</a>:

<blockquote>
  The control group consisted of barbers who encouraged lifestyle modification or referred customers with high blood pressure to physicians. In the intervention group, barbers screened patients, then handed them off to pharmacists who met with customers in the barbershops. They treated patients with medications and lifestyle changes according to set protocols, then updated physicians on what they had done.
</blockquote>

They also tweaked the process to handle the inevitable bumps in the road.

<blockquote>
  When barbers weren’t consistently screening customers by measuring their blood pressure, pharmacists stepped in to do that. When labs slowed things down, pharmacists brought measuring tests to the barbershops.
</blockquote>

The end result:

<blockquote>
  Six months into the trial, systolic blood pressure (the higher of the two blood pressure measures) in the control group had dropped about 9 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury) to 145.4, which is still high. In the intervention group, though, blood pressure had dropped 27 mm Hg to 125.8, which is close to “normal.” If we define the goal of blood pressure management to be less than 130/80, more than 63 percent of the intervention group achieved it, compared with less than 12 percent of the control group.
  
  It gets better. The rate of cohort retention — measuring how many of the patients remained plugged into the study and care throughout the entire process — was 95 percent.
</blockquote>

According to the New York Times, the researchers believed there were several important lessons that could be learned from the results of this series of studies.

<blockquote>
  Getting barbers involved meant health messages came from trusted members of the community. Locating the intervention in barbershops meant patients could receive care without inconvenience, with peer support. Using pharmacists meant that care could be delivered more efficiently.
</blockquote>

I think there's also a valuable lesson here for Makers All. If emerging tech is going to provide real opportunities to communities that our society has basically written off, we need to plug into the parts of that community that people already trust. Learning complex new tech can be really intimidating, especially because you're probably going to spend a lot of time falling on your face when you first get started. Feeling safe and knowing there are people who've got your back is half the battle. Barbershops and beauty salons, churches -- all of these institutions could play an important role.

Community institutions aren't magic. As the study also showed, it will take the right mix of institutions as well as a feedback loop to tweak the process as we learn what's working and what's not. But if we're smart about how we do it, a community-oriented approach has tremendous potential.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Disney’s Unique Take on Diversifying Its Coders</title>

				What you do have your big corporation and you want to create more diversity in your IT team? According to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40576156/most-creative-people-2018-nikki-katz-disney">Fast Company</a>, Disney has a new twist on an old strategy: offer tech retraining and apprenticeships to female "employees already well into their careers." The program, which was created by Disney VP of Technology Nikki Katz, is called CODE: Rosie.

<blockquote>
  The CODE in CODE: Rosie stands for Creating Opportunities for Diverse Engineers. The “Rosie” part references Rosie the Riveter, the symbol of World War II’s working women; an internal CODE Rosie logo even depicts Minnie Mouse in Rosie’s iconic rolled-up-sleeve pose. In particular, the program pays tribute to the “Rosies” who programmed the U.S. Army’s pioneering ENIAC computer back in the 1940s.
  
  For decades after those ENIAC coders helped make history, women played prominent roles in software engineering. But the percentage of U.S. computer-science majors who are female peaked more than 30 years ago and then spiraled downward for years. In recent years, groups such as Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code, and BRAID have worked to get young women interested in programming early, in hopes of putting them on a track to pursue an education—and then a career—in computer science. These efforts have helped, but the field’s gender imbalance remains severe.
</blockquote>

CODE: Rosie has a couple of features that make it unique. First, it's got a strong emphasis on apprenticeships inside the corporation.

<blockquote>
  After three months of training—in everything from basic computer-science concepts to programming languages such as Python—they’ll segue into a yearlong apprenticeship consisting of two six-month chunks in different teams within the company. Then they’ll have the opportunity to take a job within one of Disney’s technical groups.
</blockquote>

Second, to ensure that people who join the program understand what they're getting into, are committed enough to it that investing in them will pay off, and to give them a leg up, CODE: Rosie requires that participants do a bunch of work before they are accepted into the program.

<blockquote>
  for the first CODE: Rosie program, which kicked off in April 2016 and had a dozen available slots, applicants had to submit essays and tackle a simple coding project.... When Katz and her colleagues were formulating this year’s “CODE: Rosie 2.0,” however, they decided to front-load 40 to 60 hours of online instruction into the application process. That makes it much more of a gauntlet, especially given that a prospective Rosie must go through this material on her own time....  Along with allowing employees to show they’re serious about the CODE: Rosie program, this pre-training helps them move ahead more quickly once they’re in.
</blockquote>

Third, it provides a strong safety net that reduces the risk to participants if the program doesn't work out for them.

<blockquote>
  Disney holds particpants’ previous non-technical jobs open and gives each “Rosie” the option to return to her old role rather than continuing on her new career path. Of the 12 Rosies in the inaugural program, only one took the company up on this offer. (Another ended up leaving the company for a technical job elsewhere.)
</blockquote>

Fourth, Katz invested in building strong support for the program from key techies.

<blockquote>
  To ensure that Rosies would be welcomed, Katz worked to get advance buy-in from Disney’s tech pros. “I got this lovely email from Nikki, only a few months after hiring into Disney,” remembers lead software engineer Calvin Wong. “It was basically describing the CODE: Rosie program: ‘We’re going to take a lot of candidates, teach them a lot of software engineering skill sets, and then hopefully let these candidates explore a new career path.'” Along with other employees, Wong became a CODE: Rosie buddy, responsible for both answering day-to-day questions and providing ongoing mentorship.
  
  Wong has found that role to be rewarding, in part because the Rosies aren’t seasoned engineers. “From high school all the way until now, I’ve only being doing tech,” he says. “Having them come into the program and talk about their past experiences in consumer products and game development and all these other fields was just really eye-opening. Because I only saw the Walt Disney Company in a narrow spectrum.”
</blockquote>

It's not clear how big an impact CODE: Rosie will have. It's only in its second year and it's still very small -- and it's still too early to tell where it will go.

<blockquote>
  In a company with almost 200,000 employees around the world, a 20-person training effort like CODE: Rosie 2.0–which is open only to Los Angeles-area staffers–can’t accommodate everyone who might benefit from it. Katz emphasizes that the program is a “white glove, boutique” undertaking and there’s a limit to how far future versions could scale up. But she quickly adds that the undertaking hasn’t just changed the lives of the Rosies who get in—it’s also changed Disney.
  
  “When you do something authentically, for the right reasons, that is maybe a little different from the way we’ve tried things before, it tends to have these ripple effects in the organization.” she says.
</blockquote>

Although it's still at the very early stages, I think there may be some valuable lessons here not just for large corporations but for how we think about retraining whole communities. More on that in a future post.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>National Jobs Guarantee, Volunteer Bucks, and the Future of Work</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's amazing victory in the 14th congressional district Democratic primary this week got a lot of people <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/27/17509604/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democratic-socialist-of-america">talking about</a> the progressive ideas she ran on, one of which is a <a href="https://ocasio2018.com/issues">Federal Job Guarantee</a>. According to her website:

<blockquote>
  Alexandria endorses a Federal Jobs Guarantee, because anyone who is willing and able to work shouldn’t struggle to find employment.
  
  A Federal Jobs Guarantee would create a baseline quality for employments that guarantees a minimum $15 wage (pegged to inflation), full healthcare, and paid child and sick leave for all. This proposal would dramatically upgrade the quality of employment in the United States, by providing training and experience to workers while bringing much-needed public services to our communities in areas such as parks service, childcare and environmental conservation.
  
  Furthermore, a federal jobs guarantee program would establish a floor for wages and benefits for the nation’s workforce. This program would provide a baseline minimum wage of $15 an hour and guarantee for public workers a basic benefits package, including healthcare and childcare. By investing in our own workforce, we can lift thousands of American families out of poverty.
</blockquote>

She isn't the only one pushing for a national job guarantee. Senator Cory Booker, who has <a href="https://newrepublic.com/minutes/139825/cory-booker-not-friend">close ties</a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/23/cory-booker-mitch-mcconnell-get-the-most-wall-st-campaign-cash.html">Wall Street</a>, has introduced a bill to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/20/17260578/cory-booker-job-guarantee-bill-full-employment-darity-hamilton">test out the idea</a>.

Even in lefty circles, the idea has its critics. Dean Baker and Jared Bernstein, two of the most highly respected progressive economists, recently <a href="http://cepr.net/publications/op-eds-columns/guaranteed-jobs-in-america-motivations-and-limitations">argued</a> that a national job guarantee may have serious problems and that there may be better ways to tackle the very serious problem that "even in year nine of the current expansion that boasts a 17-year low on the unemployment rate, there are far too many people and communities left behind."

<blockquote>
  The package on offer from the one popular version of a job guarantee could be an improvement for at least 50 million currently employed workers. Even if the employers of half of these workers raise their pay to match the package offered through the job guarantee (a great outcome), that would still leave 25 million currently employed workers for whom the guaranteed job would be an upgrade.
  
  Add in the unemployed and underemployed, and this gives us more than 35 million workers in this program and, quite possibly, many more. The federal government’s current workforce, outside of the Postal Service, is 2.2 million, meaning the job guarantee would increase the size of the federal workforce by a factor of 10.
  
  Sen. Cory Booker (D–N.J.) recently introduced a three-year pilot program offering a guaranteed job in 15 urban and rural places. That’s a smart way to proceed, one that should allow us to see if our concerns are justified. If so, local governments in the pilot areas will find themselves having to essentially re-create the private low-wage labor market by undertaking a huge expansion of public-sector jobs.
  
  Therefore, it makes sense to also try a less interventionist approach to job creation. Various members of Congress, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D–Md.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D–Calif.), are rolling out ideas for subsidized jobs programs that target long-term jobless workers and/or those with persistent poverty-level earnings. The job would have to pay at least the minimum wage, and employers, who could be in the public, private or nonprofit sector, would receive a subsidy to cover wages, overhead and training costs. Unlike many earlier versions of such plans, these subsidies would last for a significant period: at least 18 months, and possibly as long as 30 months (with the opportunity for subsidized workers to “re-up” with a different employer if necessary).
</blockquote>

I definitely think we need to do something about the fact that our economy has left too many individuals and to many communities behind. I'm not convinced a national job guarantee is the answer -- I think we'd be better off with a more inclusive version of the strategies the US used to create jobs right after World War II, where we used both subsidies and shaped the rules of housing, agriculture, autos, electronics, healthcare, and other industries to create the greatest mass-based prosperity the world has ever seen. But it this point, I'd settle for anything we can get signed into law in the next few years.

But in the longer term, if robots and AI end up wiping out more jobs than they create, I don't think the solution is to create more jobs. It just seems crazy to me that as we create the capacity to automate away a lot of crappy work we wouldn't take advantage of this and reduce the need for people to work full-time.

For example, why not push for something like Volunteer Bucks? The idea is that anyone could earn a few hours of pay each month for volunteering in the community, and people who were having trouble finding enough paid work could earn more hours per month. Volunteer Bucks would provide income security and give people more flexibility in how they spent their time -- especially if it was combined with a small amount of Universal Basic Income.

In the short term, I don't think it would make sense to implement Volunteer Bucks plus a UBI. It'd be too expensive today, and we aren't facing mass unemployment. But if we fight to create an economy where <a href="https://makersall.org/ma-framework/">as many people in every community can generate wealth from robotics, AI, and other emerging tech</a>, we should be able to create a level of prosperity where we could easily afford that kind of safety net.

I don't know if Volunteer Bucks + UBI is the long term right policy. But whatever we decide to fight for, the coming revolution in emerging tech offers us a unique opportunity to rethink the world of work. Let's not waste it.

————-

UPDATE: this piece wasn’t intended as a criticism of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I'm big fan of hers:  she's exactly the kind of politician our country needs right now. And I’d have to be pretty out of it to expect anyone running for office in 2018 to have a platform that was focusing on long term questions like how what robots/AI might do to our communities in 10+ years. I was using the idea of a national jobs guarantee as a springboard for talking about where we want to be headed down the road.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>1949 NY Ag Extension Services to Today&#039;s Techies: Step Up Your Game</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				As part of learning more about the <a href="/2017/12/13/what-agricultural-extension-services-history-can-teach-us-about-democratizing-technology/">history of Agricultural Extension Services</a>, I've been reading Ruby Green Smith's <a href="http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100545940">The People's Colleges: A History of the New York State Extension Service in Cornell University and the State, 1876-1948</a>. Cornell University was a leader in Agricultural Extension Services. Although the national program wasn't created until 1914, Cornell University started doing extension work way back in in the 1870s. Writing in 1949, Smith says that "the most common definition" of what Cornell did is that it took the knowledge and research of academia and "translated it into life through its application to farms, homes, industries, and communities." [p.xxx] But the actual history was a complex dance between top-down and bottom-up.

<blockquote>
  A home Bureau leader, Grace Austin Powell, wrote: "the Home Bureau is a door in the walls of a home -- a door swinging both ways. It swings in word so that from the State Colleges instruction and inspiration may enter; it swings outward so that from the home may come the rich experience and wisdom which years of home life have given to many a wife and mother."
  [...]
  There is vigorous reciprocity in the Extension Service because it is <em>with</em> the people, as well as "of the people, by the people, and for the people" it not only carries knowledge from the State Colleges to the people, but it also works in reverse: it carries from the people to their State Colleges practical knowledge whose workability has been tested on farms, in industry, in homes, and in communities. In ideal extension work, science and art meet life and practice.... Thus the Extension Service develops not only better agriculture, industries, homes, and communities, but better colleges." [p. xxxi]
</blockquote>

That sounds pretty interesting, and there are certainly lessons we can learn from their experience. But it isn't that far from some traditional progressive thinking about how to democratize tech. What blew me away was the next paragraph:

<blockquote>
  In 1948, more than 32,000 trained volunteer local leaders and community committee members supplemented the agricultural and home economics work of the salaried staff of 383." [pp. xxxi-xxxii]
</blockquote>

Let's say that again: in 1948, New York Agricultural Extension Services had 32,000 volunteer local leaders. Not members. Leaders.

If you think the idea of making jobs/work in emerging tech accessible to many people in every community seems like a pipe dream, that's one reason why. I'm not saying we need that many volunteer leaders -- or that many paid staff -- to succeed. But it's a useful reminder how much we are used to thinking on a small scale.		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				For the <a href="/2018/05/10/686/">report</a> I'm writing -- on making developing emerging tech accessible to as many people as possible in communities from Compton to Harlan County -- in August I'm going to do a deep dive on the User Experience (UX) of coding. As I learn interesting tidbits, I'm going to blog them. So that means this month's blog posts will be geekier than usual.

For those of you who aren't from the geeky side, apologies in advance; I'll try to make what I'm learning as accessible as possible but it's going to take a couple of weeks before I know how to really break it down. In September I'll switch back to writing about community-oriented approaches, starting with several posts about what efforts to make tech accessible can learn from the 1960s civil rights movement's Citizenship Schools.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What is User Experience (UX)?</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/what-is-user-experience-ux/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 13:12:37 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[aschneiderman]]></dc:creator>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Although there are many ways to describe user experience (UX) design, one of the simplest and best <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/">definitions</a> comes from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, whose founders were pioneers in the UX movement:

<blockquote>
  The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use. True user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company's offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design.
</blockquote>

A core part of UX is the concept of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability">usability</a>:

<blockquote>
  Usability is a <strong>quality attribute</strong> that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use....  Usability is defined by 5 quality components:
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Learnability</strong>: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?</li>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?</li>
  <li><strong>Memorability</strong>: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?</li>
  <li><strong>Errors</strong>: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?</li>
  <li><strong>Satisfaction</strong>: How pleasant is it to use the design?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

There are a bewildering array of techniques you can use for usability studies, but one of the most powerful is user testing. Here's how the Nielsen Norman Group describes what it is and how you do it:

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Get hold of some representative users, such as customers for an ecommerce site or employees for an intranet (in the latter case, they should work outside your department).</li>
  <li>Ask the users to perform representative tasks with the design.</li>
  <li>Observe what the users do, where they succeed, and where they have difficulties with the user interface. Shut up and let the users do the talking.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

Although usability testing can be pretty elaborate, even very simple approaches can provide very useful results:

<blockquote>
  To identify a design's most important usability problems, testing 5 users is typically enough. Rather than run a big, expensive study, it's a better use of resources to run many small tests and revise the design between each one so you can fix the usability flaws as you identify them. Iterative design is the best way to increase the quality of user experience. The more versions and interface ideas you test with users, the better.
</blockquote>

In the world of web/mobile, UX has had a deep and profound impact on how designers work. You can go to conferences about it, take courses in it, even get a job doing it. If a corporation, nonprofit, or government is serious about reaching their audience, they've got staff and/or consultants who live and breathe UX. As you know from surfing the web, not everyone takes it seriously. But for anybody serious about designing websites and apps, UX is a critical tool in their arsenal.

But in the world of the tools, languages, and frameworks/libraries for coding? There are certainly some folks who are using UX, but my guess is that either it's not widespread or the users most coding UX efforts target aren't regular folks; that's one of the issues I'm researching.  Either way, as someone who's taught a lot of adult beginners I think there's a tremendous amount of room for improvement.

The one area where you can see the impact of UX work on coding is tools aimed at little kids. The best example of this is <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, an MIT project that's been wildly successful.

Better UX for adult coding won't by itself solve the gap in the accessibility of coding jobs and creating wealth via coding; for that I think we also need a more deeply community-oriented approach to making coding accessible.  But better coding UX can make a critical difference.		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				Two years ago, I was managing a team of developers and analysts who were creating a "metadata driven data warehouse" that would make it easy for our many different types of users to slice and dice their often complex data to satisfy their unique needs. We'd finished the core system, and we were just about to start cranking out a series of custom mini-data warehouses when we discovered a tool called Alteryx. Alteryx was expensive, but it promised to remove most of the need for any coding; any "power user" who is comfortable with Excel could do very sophisticated analysis by dragging and dropping to their heart's content.

Given how complex our needs were, deciding either way it was a pretty big risk. So, we decided to do a quick and dirty bake-off. I felt sick, because from the outside it looked like making a big change in our strategy and going with Alteryx was the way to go. But much to my surprise, Alteryx's shiny drag-and-drop approach got its butt kicked.

A lot of the reasons we stuck with our original approach were because of the unique problems and constraints we faced.  But the bake-off also uncovered a fundamental weakness with a drag-and-drop approach. Something graphical works great when you've got a simple problem. But to do just about anything our users wanted, first you needed to prep the data by joining together a bunch of tables of data and sift it using complex logic. And that level of complexity produced a graphical picture that looked like a scene out of a rat's nest or an episode of Hoarders. Paradoxically, if you used text -- i.e., code -- to capture that complexity, it was much easier to understand.

So as I begin my deep dive into the research on improving the user experience (UX) of coding, it's worth remembering that sometimes a picture isn't worth a thousand words. Or to put it another way, sometimes a bunch of words are worth a lot more than a picture.		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				In an interview this week for the report, a designer said that if we are trying to make coding easier, we could learn a thing or two from the game Minecraft.  Although there have been some experiments at <a href="https://minecraft.makecode.com/">making programming Minecraft more accessible</a>, it's not the easiest platform to code. And yet Minecraft has almost <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/minecraft-has-74-million-monthly-players-2018-1">75 million monthly players</a>, some of whom are kids who've tried their hand at coding it.

It's not too hard to understand why. Minecraft is a hell of a lot of fun, and many kids become obsessed with it. And learning to code on it is almost like learning to cast spells.  In his <a href="https://education.minecraft.net/lessons/coding-in-minecraft-an-intro/">intro to Minecraft coding</a>, for example, Minecraft Education Manager Peter Olofsson says he likes to start off by teaching students how to create a command to teleport their "agent."  Any coding class where the first thing you learn to do is how to teleport is a class that's gotten off on the right start.

Given that so much user experience design work is focused on usability testing, it's easy to forget that easy to use is only one part of the user experience ecosystem. As discussed <a href="/2018/08/01/what-is-user-experience-ux/">previously</a>, here's how the Nielsen Norman Group <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/definition-user-experience/">defines</a> the objectives of user experience design:

<blockquote>
  The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use.
</blockquote>

Minecraft coding has a fair amount of fuss and bother, and you probably wouldn't call it elegant. But when it comes to "a joy to use", it knocks it out of the park.

If we want to ensure as many people as possible in every community have access to emerging tech jobs and business/startup/co-op opportunities, we're going to need a lot of usability work to make coding as easy as possible. But we also shouldn't underestimate the power of play.		]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I've been reading a marvelous book by Katherine Mellen Charron called <a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9780807872222/freedoms-teacher/">Freedom's Teacher: The Life of Septima Clark</a>. Described by Martin Luther King, Jr. as "the Mother of the Movement," Septima Clark was the architect and creator of one of the most remarkable inventions of the civil rights movement: Citizenship Schools.

To block as many African Americans as possible from voting, most Southern states required voters pass a literacy test. Citizenship Schools were an amazing, massive effort to train African-Americans across the South to read and write in a relatively short period of time. They also served as a means for identifying new grassroots leaders for the Civil Rights Movement.

I think techies who want to democratize technology can learn some really valuable lessons from Citizenship Schools. I've already mentioned Citizenship Schools in my framework and several posts I've written. But since most techies haven't heard of them, I'm going to use <em>Freedom's Teacher</em> to write a series of posts that explain how Citizenship Schools worked and what they can teach us. And since Clark already had decades of experience as a teacher and activist before she created Citizenship Schools, in this first post I'm going to follow <em>Freedom's Teacher</em> and use Clark's early history to paint a portrait of forces that shaped the Schools' creation.

The fight in the South over literacy went back far before when Clark was born in 1898.

<blockquote>
  Freedmen and -women [i.e., freed slaves] well understood that their future economic and political security depended on securing basic literacy skills and pursued them with equal fervor in both the city and the country. How else could one be certain of the terms of the annual labor contracts he or she signed? How else might one retain the privilege of owning property by identifying the letter in the mailbox as a tax bill? (p. 40) .... More broadly, disfranchised African Americans in South Carolina and across the region viewed education as a primary battlefield in the struggle to undermine white supremacy and to reestablish themselves as citizens. (p. 52)
</blockquote>

Schools also eventually became an important site of struggle because of some of their unique properties. In the decades before the 1960s civil rights movement, a direct confrontation with white supremacy, such as multiracial union organizing and/or strikes, was almost always met with terrorist violence and death. In contrast, by the early 20th century, schools were a place where African-Americans could win victories inch by inch without taking on as much risk.

One of several reasons why there was room to maneuver with schools was how Southern white elites treated public schools for African-Americans. They made no bones about the fact that they didn't want black schools to flourish.

<blockquote>
  "The objections to negro education arise chiefly from the feeling that it unfits the negro for the place he must fill in the state" as a manual or agricultural laborer, one white South Carolina educational official reported in 1911, "and that the so-called educated negro too often becomes a loafer or a political agitator." (p. 53)
</blockquote>

But there was also an opportunity African American teachers could take advantage of.

<blockquote>
  From afar and in theory, white concern for black education remained hostile; up close and in practice, it manifested itself as indifference. As long as these circumstances prevailed, black teachers in rural southern schools operated with a considerable degree of autonomy. (p. 69) ... [Black schoolteachers] "knew that the supervisor or superintendent only came around every five or six months and when they came everything had to be exactly so," [Clark] recalled. "Any information we were learning about black people would be set aside and all teachers made sure we were working on the official curriculum." (p. 70)
</blockquote>

But as Clark discovered when she had her first job as a as a teacher in a rural one-room schoolhouse on John's Island in 1916, to take full advantage of these opportunities, black teachers couldn't use a standard approach to education. Like many rural African Amercans, most black folks on John's Island were very poor and had virtually no access to services -- there wasn't even a doctor on the island. Making progress on literacy

<blockquote>
  required teachers to tap the community’s primary resource, its people. Visiting and listening came first. Only then could teachers motivate children and adults to want to learn and help them devise strategies for applying that learning. (p. 79)
</blockquote>

Clark spent several years teaching on John's Island, and her experiences there shaped many of the ideas behind the design of Citizenship Schools.

Another strong influence on Citizenship Schools were the networks built by black teachers's organizations and black club women. As Clark experienced through a series of teaching positions and activist work throughout South Carolina,

<blockquote>
  Over the next few decades, women in a growing number of local clubs built an extensive network that reached into every city, town, and hamlet across South Carolina (p. 134) ... Former teacher and Charlestonian clubwoman Mamie Garvin Fields observed, "The point was to have the next generation come up knowing how to organize themselves and take their rightful place in the community" (p. 135).
</blockquote>

For example:

<blockquote>
  In 1931, Modjeska Simkins became a field worker for the South Carolina Tuberculosis Association, charged with the duty of raising health awareness through education. She approached teachers first, addressing them at state and county meetings and parent-teacher association gatherings. Next, Simkins organized a two-day institute in the summer teacher training sessions at South Carolina State.... Simkins’s success depended on tapping into preexisting networks. Teachers who attended county PSTA meetings and summer sessions or who, as Septima Clark had on Johns Island in the 1910s, organized local parent-teacher groups buttressed that statewide infrastructure.... Among black Carolinians, African American teachers and clubwomen helped contribute to a 53 percent decline in the tuberculosis death rate between the wars. (p. 136)
</blockquote>

The recurring lesson from this work:

<blockquote>
  "Real leadership," Etta B. Rowe asserted, "does not mean standing at the head of an organization—real leadership is that technique . . . that induces others to work and perform in a like manner." (p. 137)
</blockquote>

Clark also spent several decades working with and eventually for the NAACP. The NAACP's membership "increased ninefold" during World War II, and from the late 1940s through the 1950s it was involved in a series of efforts to desegregate a variety of institutions. Although "the majority of African American teachers chose not to risk their livelihoods by publicly supporting the NAACP" (p. 175), the NAACP was the central player in the fight for the right of black teachers to work in public schools and the fight to inch towards parity between black and white teachers' salary. By 1956, Clark became the vice president of the NAACP Charleston chapter.

By 1956, southern whites were once again mounting a counter-attack against efforts to win equality for African Americans, triggered this time in no small part by the 1954 Supreme Court Brown V Board of Ed decision. Some of their response was the violence and physical intimidation most of us have heard of.

<blockquote>
  "Since those nine buzzards on the Supreme Court have abolished the Mason-Dixon line," one anonymous [KKK] member told an interviewer, "we had to establish the Smith &amp; Wesson line".... Reflecting on [one] incident, [a] beaten man’s pastor succinctly stated, "Fear covers South Carolina like the frost." (p. 237)
</blockquote>

And some of it was by employing the full force of Southern white elite's legal and economic power.

<blockquote>
  Portraying the NAACP as a communist front, southern state legislatures passed laws requiring the association to hand over its membership lists and financial statements to white officials or be shut down (p. 238).... Banks began to require African American loan applicants to sign statements swearing that they neither were nor planned to become NAACP members (p. 239).... [In 1956, South Carolina] Governor Timmerman signed into law a bill that that barred city, county, and state employees from belonging to the NAACP (p. 243).
</blockquote>

To survive against these brutal pressures, black civil rights activists had to rely on the deep networks that tied their communities together. Even so, many activists paid a high price -- when Clark refused to resign from the NAACP, the school district fired from her teaching position and robbed her of her 40 year pension.

After Clark was fired, she eventually ended up at an institution that she'd been trained at several years before and had built a relationship with: the Highlander Folk School. Highlander's early history is the last piece in understanding the forces that shaped Citizenship Schools.

Highlander was opened in late 1932. It was influenced by a variety of movements, from Denmark folk schools to the efforts in the US at citizenship education.

<blockquote>
  Clark had been moving in educational circles that specifically addressed matters of "citizenship education" for twenty years. Yet what had in the 1930s been a strategy for fighting fascism became in the 1950s a way to win the Cold War, endorsed by no less than Dwight D. Eisenhower. Beginning in the fall of 1951, for example, Charleston’s city school board launched its Citizenship Education Project in two white high schools. (p. 247)
</blockquote>

When Highlander first opened its doors, it was driven by the goals of "educating 'rural and industrial leaders for a new social order' and preserving and enriching 'the indigenous cultural values of the mountains.' Initially, it focused on the Depression era southern labor movement. But over the next 20 years it began to shift its focus, and by 1953, its board decided to make race relations the center of its work (p. 220).

Highlander gave Clark tools to build on her already impressive work. For example,

<blockquote>
  Like black clubwomen, [Highlander] defined leadership not as standing at the head of an organization but as assuming the responsibility to get others involved. Yet the [Highlander] concept of leadership emphasized ordinary people—not necessarily self-conscious community leaders—taking part in the decision-making process and devising plans on their own terms and according to their own needs. (p. 216)
</blockquote>

Highlander also helped Clark deepen and strengthen her skills as a mentor, and it taught her new strategies for employing data to guide decision making -- "Highlander helped me to consider numbers when thinking of memberships, to interview for concrete data, and to survey for reliable facts" (p. 222).

By 1958, Clark had so impressed the Highlander staff that she was hired as the director of education, where she oversaw Highlander's educational fieldwork. Over the next few years, she developed and implemented the first Citizenship Schools.

Up Next: how Citizenship Schools worked -- and why.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What Emerging Tech Coding UX Can Learn From Cookbook Recipes</title>
		<link>https://makersall.org/what-recipes-can-teach-us-about-coding/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
				I have a confession to make: I'm a recovering cookbook addict. I still buy cookbooks, but only two or three times a year (okay, maybe four or five times). While I was a cookbook addict, I acquired a pretty good sized collection.

And of all the cookbooks I own, not one of them uses pictures instead of words to describe their recipes.

Some of the cookbooks do contain pictures. Most of those pictures show what the food will -- in theory -- look like once you finish the recipe. A few use pictures to walk you through a particular cooking technique. But the recipes themselves are described using words.

Despite that, many people who aren't professional cooks can figure out how to make these recipes. How many actually make the recipes they read is a question for another day. But if my and my friends' experience is any indication, when recipes don't get made it's not for lack of being able to read them.

Cookbook recipes use words whose meaning aren't obvious to beginners. For example, here's a recipe for a <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/recipe/black-bean-and-sweet-potato-chili">black bean and sweet potato chili</a> (minus the ingredients list):

<blockquote>
  In a large pot heat the tablespoon of water or vegetable broth. Add the onion and garlic, stirring constantly so it does not stick. Add the salt, cumin, chili powder, and oregano. Cook for 30 seconds.
  
  Add the sweet potato and cook for about 3 minutes. Add the tomato, water, and beans. Cover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Ensure the sweet potatoes are cooked.
</blockquote>

And here's a recipe for <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012538-mexican-chocolate-tofu-pudding">chocolate pudding</a>:

<blockquote>
  In a small pot, combine sugar with 3/4 cup water; bring to a boil and cook until sugar is dissolved, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly.
  
  Put all ingredients except for chocolate shavings in a blender and purée until completely smooth, stopping machine to scrape down its sides if necessary. Divide among 4 to 6 ramekins and chill for at least 30 minutes. If you like, garnish with chocolate shavings before serving.
</blockquote>

(By the way, in this recipe author Mark Bittman shows you how to make really good chocolate mousse where one of the main ingredients is… tofu. I kid you not. It took me two years before I was ready to try making it -- not because I couldn't read the recipe, but because combining tofu and chocolate sounded absolutely disgusting. Turns out it tastes ridiculously good, which a friend of mine is convinced is one of the signs of an impending apocalypse)

If you're an absolute beginner, you won't know how to read these recipes. You'll need to learn a few things before you can use them. In the chocolate pudding recipe, for example, what does it mean to "bring to a boil" and how do you know when the "sugar is dissolved"? What is "stirring" and how often should you stir the ingredients so you're "stirring occasionally"?

But figuring this out isn't rocket science. There are millions of beginners who with some help from family or friends, classes, or just messing around learn how to become good cooks.

That doesn't mean that the degree of complexity or weirdness of the terms used in recipes doesn't matter. It took a while for the world of cookbook authors to figure out what kind of words and what degree of complexity worked for beginning cooks, let alone to standardize the meaning of the terms they used.

It's certainly worth exploring if coding using a visually oriented system is a better way to go than writing text. But as the decades of experience with cookbooks shows us, sometimes a picture isn't worth a thousand words. And sometimes only a handful of the right words is all beginning cooks need to rock it out.		]]></content:encoded>

				I used to blog one substantive piece every week, and I almost never missed a week.  That hasn't been happening for the last few months as I've been working on the report.      I keep trying to get back to it, and I keep blowing my own deadlines.

So, from now until the report is out -- probably mid- to late January -- I'll be posting sporadically.  I may also try to fill in a bit more with interesting tidbits that aren't a serious post, but no promises.		]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Announcing Makers All 2.0</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally, the new version of Makers All is up and running! Originally, the project was focused on how to respond to the impact AI and robots may have on jobs. What I eventually realized is that this scope was too broad. For example:

<ul>
    <li>I didn't want to spend a lot of time in arguments over proposals like Universal Basic Income, which could provide a piece of the puzzle but aren't comprehensive enough to tackle the problem</li>
    <li>There are other pieces of the puzzle that other folks are far better equipped to take on. For example, this week Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri published an extremely important book called <a href="https://ghostwork.info">Ghost Work</a>, which is a brilliant ethnography &amp; analysis of all the low paid work that goes into AI and the "<a href="https://medium.com/@maryLgray/the-paradox-of-automation-s-last-mile-7d648f990996">last mile automation</a>" problem</li>
    <li>Focusing just on robots and AI instead of all of emerging tech increasing felt too limiting</li>
</ul>

So, a pivot to 2.0. Makers All is now focused on the question, how do we help communities from Harlem to Harlan County, who our society has basically written off, grab a large enough piece of the wealth emerging tech will generate in the coming decades so they can use that wealth to help revitalize their communities?

I've written a report about this new strategy. It's available as either a <a href="https://makersall.org/home/makers-all-report/">PDF</a> or a website called the <a href="https://toolkit.makersall.org/">Toolkit</a>, which is designed to be easier to skim. As the Makers All project grows, I hope to use the Toolkit as a repository of links, articles, etc on everything we learn about turning this new vision into reality.]]></content:encoded>
