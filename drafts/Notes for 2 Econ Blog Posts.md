Post #1

3 areas of big change:
- Emerging Tech
- Green Jobs / Green New Deal
- Graying of America

For Each of These Areas, We Need to:
- Make higher-paying jobs accessible to all communities
- Transform lower paying jobs into better paying jobs
(not necessarily high school versus low skill)




Post #2

We Need a Community-Centered Approach

1) Connections/pathways by region as well as state
(including making it easier)

2) Visible/Accountable
- Politicians talk jobs all the time but don't really mean it; that's one reason why a lot of folks don't vote, because I think nothing will happen this time either
- The UX of good jobs for all
  - Someone in Compton can see of politicians are BSing them
- But also designed to get real -- what is possible?
- Political payout: can mobilize around
