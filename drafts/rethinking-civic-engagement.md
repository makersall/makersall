title: What Is the New Georgia Project Equivalent for Governing?
author: Anders Schneiderman

In the past few years, among liberals and progressives there's been a dramatic change in how many politicians run for office. Bernie Sander's campaigns, Justice Democrats, Run for Something, Indivisible, Pod Save America, and others have shown how you can win political campaigns by combining old school grassroots political organizing and new tech, fueled more by lots of small dollar donors than by big-money donors.  The most striking example is the [New Georgia Project]( https://newgeorgiaproject.org/), whose brilliant deep organizing changed the face of US politics.

Now that we've got at least a rough consensus of a model of a grassroots-oriented approach to winning office, what's a similarly grassroots-oriented approach to governing? And what does that look like in a world where on the one hand we've got more and more examples of the good role that data & other tech can play in it, such as the civic tech movement, as well as really bad examples, such as the police mass surveillance that [Data for Black Lives]( https://twitter.com/Data4BlackLives)' [#NoMoreDataWeapons](https://blog.d4bl.org/introducing-nomoredataweapons/) campaign is targeting). 

I only have a very rough idea of where I want to go with this. And although it's been inspired by partisan political campaigns, I think I want to develop a nonpartisan framework that would lay the groundwork for some of the community-oriented direction I think Makers All is headed towards. But again, it's all pretty rough right now.

What does the New Georgia Project look like for governing, especially in an era where cities are lurching towards becoming more data-driven in a good civic tech way and in a bad way, e.g., mass surveillance (e.g., Data for Black Lives)? The UX for activists, non-activist churches, etc., and progressive politicians. And the solutions that scale.

- Being playful with data so that it's more seductive, more accessible
- Making civic participation more fun, more theatrical / more like a game/playful (while still being substantive and thoughtful)
- making data-driven civic engagement more democratic and more engaging for janitors as well as techies, and how that can help lay the groundwork for Makers All
- Solutions that scale: shouldn't have to reinvent the wheel. Even though every city, state is different, shouldn't have to completely reinvent the wheel
