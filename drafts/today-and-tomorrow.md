I keep meaning to blog.  But something keeps holding me back — it’s a little weird to be thinking about the trajectory of emerging tech and our economy over the next 20 years when you’re in the middle of a pandemic.  

But a pandemic can strip you to your core.  It can make you painfully aware of what’s fundamentally important and what’s not.

And in my case, given how my body is doing I’m so limited in my ability to help people right here and now, and it’s driving me a little crazy.  

So if I can’t be as immediately useful as I want today, maybe I can take a little time each week to think about how we can help the people helping us, help the people who are hurting, tomorrow.

Because the one lesson I’ve learned the hard way — over and over — during my life, it’s that if you don’t carve out a little time today to think about tomorrow, you’ll regret it 10 years from now.

{need to think more about how to say this is about emerging tech wo spending a lot of time saying it, and say this is something I’ve been wrestling with
