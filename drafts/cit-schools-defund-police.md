	Another strong influence on Citizenship Schools were the networks built by black teachers’s organizations and black club women. As Clark experienced through a series of teaching positions and activist work throughout South Carolina,

	Over the next few decades, women in a growing number of local clubs built an extensive network that reached into every city, town, and hamlet across South Carolina (p. 134) … Former teacher and Charlestonian clubwoman Mamie Garvin Fields observed, “The point was to have the next generation come up knowing how to organize themselves and take their rightful place in the community” (p. 135).


	In 1931, Modjeska Simkins became a field worker for the South Carolina Tuberculosis Association, charged with the duty of raising health awareness through education. She approached teachers first...  Among black Carolinians, African American teachers and clubwomen helped contribute to a 53 percent decline in the tuberculosis death rate between the wars.

> By being deeply embedded in communities, Citizenship Schools were able to leverage a community’s strengths, including the bonds of friendship and support. For example:

> When recruiting a school’s teachers, they targeted people who civil rights activist Dorothy Cotton described as “people with Ph.D. minds who never had the chance to get an education who were the natural leaders in their communities”
Teachers often mobilized people in the community to help set up the physical space of the school, which could be located in the back room of a local store, a church, a beauty parlor, or other community institutions, which also allowed them to hide the school from local white elites
Teachers used local social networks to recruit students, who might be leery of taking a class not only because of the fear of white reprisals but also because of the stigma of illiteracy
When students’ training was over, teachers encouraged them to recruit their friends, neighbors, and other people from their community to take the next class
Be Responsive to Local Needs, but Operate at Scale

> Citizenship Schools were grounded in helping people develop more self-sufficiency in their daily lives and gain an understanding of how they could help change their local community. At the beginning of the first class, for example, teachers would ask students what they wanted to be able to do with reading and writing – e.g., being able to read documents you had to sign – which were then incorporated into the class. Classes also often discussed local community issues and how they might be addressed.

> Although Citizenship Schools were designed to incorporate the unique circumstances and needs of an individual community, to play an important role in changing the South they had to operate at scale. According to historian J. Douglas Allen-Taylor:

> The Citizenship School Movement trained more than 10,000 community leaders from 1957 to 1970 through nearly 1,000 grassroots, independent schools that operated at one time or another in every county in South Carolina, nearly 90 counties in Georgia, and in all of the heavily-Black areas of the rest of the Deep South. At one point in 1964, almost 200 schools operated simultaneously. Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young… said that the Citizenship Schools were the “foundation” of the civil rights movement, “as much responsible for transforming the South as anything anybody did.”


There were 2 reasons for this approach. First, [according](https://www.crmvet.org/info/cs.htm) to Clark in Literacy and Liberation,

> The basic purpose of the citizenship schools is discovering and developing local community leaders. One of the unique practical features of the concept is the ability to adapt at once to specific situations and stay in the local picture only long enough to help in the development of local leaders. These are trained to carry on an ever growing program of community development. The secret stems from the emphasis and the reliance on local leadership. It is my belief that creative leadership is present in any community and only awaits discovery and development.
