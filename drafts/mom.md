The last time I saw my mom was the tail end of Christmas in 2019.

My mom had uterine cancer that had been killing her over several years. She had deteriorated a lot in 2019, and watching her as the amazing person I knew and loved slowly began to fade away was excruciating.

She died a few months later. And because of an injury to my knees that I was still recovering from, I wasn't able to get back to see her before she was gone.

But as awful as it was, I knew she was in good hands. Not only my dad, and the many friends she had around her. But in the last few weeks, because of the astonishing people in [Francis House](https://francishouseny.org).

According to their website,

> Provides a home and extended family to persons with terminal illnesses so they can die with dignity surrounded by the unconditional love of God.
> 
> We would use our lived experience as a resource for others

As excruciating as that time was, I don't know how I would've gotten through it without the amazing folks at Francis House.


The fabulous people who take care of my brother, who has {ask Chelli how to describe it}


more folks intend acutely aware of how much our lives depend on other people who society. Becoming more aware of the fact that we need to be there for them -- and to ensure that the wealth we generate that society values so highly also goes back to the people who make it possible and bring meaning and other things of immeasurable value into our lives. That we are their allies, their neighbors in ensuring that they and their children can lead lives of dignity and respect and security.

Also coming to terms with how direct actions in tech, how we need to do something in shaping the tech so that everyone benefits.
E.g., Data for Black Lives
Design Justice Network

What I want to focus my Makers All work is on how to make the tech they make possible really payoff for them and their kids
- Open up more ways that they can make money and security
- Work with them to steer our field so it helps them in their community as it truly lives up to rhetoric about creativity

Got a bit of a start: Design Justice Network

In the next two months, drill down on specifics.
For us: ethical, but also bigger, bolder, more amazing economy.

Because tech is just getting started -- next 20 years
