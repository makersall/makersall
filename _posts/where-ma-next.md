title: 'Two New Directions for Makers All'
---

Since I published Makers All's [flagship report](https://toolkit.makersall.org/) last May, I've been talking with people in the tech world and the community organizing world about what worked in the report and what didn't.  I've also been running a variety of small pilot projects to start testing out some of the ideas in the report.  

I've also been struggling to deal with the loss of my mom a few months before the report came out.  Although I had many, many wonderful years with her, and although after a long fight with cancer she was in bad enough shape that it was time, losing her was more devastating than I'd expected.  I'm in my mid-50s, and for some silly reason I thought losing her would be painful but easier to handle given that I was reaching that point in my life where almost everyone loses their parents.  I had no idea how brutal that loss is no matter how old you are.

But nine months later, I'm starting to feel a bit human again.  And after nine months of grief and what felt like failing forward slowly, I finally know where I'm headed next with Makers All.

For the next phase of Makers All, I'm going to focus on two areas: 
- Using the burgeoning -- and awkwardly named -- field of machine learning intelligibility to test out and rethink Makers All's [Smoothing the Learning Curve](https://toolkit.makersall.org/pages/30-smooth/00-index.html) 
- Reframing Makers All's work on making emerging tech jobs accessible to communities that have been locked out so that it fits with some other big economic changes we need to wrap our heads around, especially green jobs and the Green New Deal 

In the next two posts, I'll give a quick overview of these two new projects.
